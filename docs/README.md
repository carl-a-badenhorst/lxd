# Docs

Project documentation lives here. Use lowercase, hyphenated file names.

**Standard names (see NAMING.md):**
- `design-rationale.md` — design decisions and rationale
- `learning-objectives.md` — learning outcomes and objectives

Add other doc types as needed (e.g. workshop design notes, framework references).
