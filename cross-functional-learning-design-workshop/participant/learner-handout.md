## How to Use This Workbook

This workbook is yours. Write in it. The prompts are structured to build on each other, so work through them in order and bring the workbook to the 30-day follow-up session.

You will be asked to write before discussion in almost every phase. That sequencing is deliberate: individual thinking before group conversation produces better ideas and reduces the pull toward the most confident voice in the room.

---

## Key Terms

Before the workshop begins, review these terms. We will use them consistently throughout the session.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Schema** | Organised knowledge structures in long-term memory |
| **Retrieval** | Actively recalling information from memory — not re-reading it |
| **Cognitive load** | The mental effort required during learning |
| **Extraneous load** | Effort that does not contribute to schema formation |
| **Germane load** | Effort that builds understanding |
| **Object of design** | The shared cognitive outcome all roles are working toward |
| **Activity system** | A social structure where multiple roles coordinate tools, rules and artefacts toward a shared outcome |
| **Durable capability** | The ability to perform competently in real conditions, 6 to 12 months after a learning experience |

## Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object

### Writing prompt 1A

Define learning in one sentence. Write without looking at the glossary above.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Writing prompt 1B

How do you know when learning has happened?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### The operational definition

After the facilitator introduces it, write the definition here in your own words:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Writing prompt 1C

Apply the definition to your current work.

**What must learners be able to do 6 to 12 months after your module or programme, in real conditions?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**What cognitive change must occur for that to be possible?** (What must change in their mental models, schemas or judgment?)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## Phase 2 — Learning Science Core

### Recall task

Without looking at your notes or the glossary, write the three learning science commitments from the pre-work.

1.

&nbsp;

2.

&nbsp;

3.

&nbsp;

---

### Role-based application

Work through these prompts with your role group.

**Where is retrieval structured in your typical design work?** Name a specific artefact or moment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**Where might cognitive load be excessive?** Name a specific place in a module, assessment or platform.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**Where is thinking hidden?** Where do learners perform activity without their reasoning being visible?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Worked example notes

Use this space to note the misalignment the facilitator demonstrates.

**Module outcome:**

&nbsp;

**Assessment:**

&nbsp;

**Misalignment:**

&nbsp;

**Why it impairs learning:**

&nbsp;

---

## Phase 3 — Role Mapping

### Part A: Role clarification

Work through the prompts for your role below.

---

**If your role is Curriculum Design:**

Where does this module align with programme-level capability? What is the specific link?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Where is knowledge reinforced over time in the programme? List two or three points.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How is sequencing designed to support transfer? What comes before and after this module, and why?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**If your role is Learning or Experience Design:**

What cognitive operations must learners practise? List them specifically (not just "understand" or "apply").

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Where is retrieval embedded in the design? Name the specific mechanism and timing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How is reasoning externalised? Where must learners produce visible thinking, not just correct answers?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**If your role is Multimedia Design:**

What cognitive function does each major media element serve? List the elements and their functions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Where does media reduce extraneous load? Where might it add it?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How does representation support schema formation? Which concepts require visual or spatial representation?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

**If your role is Learning Technology:**

What platform affordances enable retrieval, feedback and collaboration in this design?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Where does platform structure constrain pedagogy? What can the platform not do that the design requires?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What analytics or data would inform iteration on this design?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Part B: Cross-role perspective taking

**Your partner's role:**

**Their design decision:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Which learning science commitment does it serve — or violate?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Their observation about your decision:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis

### Your team's artefact

Note the artefact your team is working with:

**Module or assessment name:**

**Role that created it:**

**Programme context (if known):**

---

### Stage 1: Identify

Work through these questions as a team. Write your team's answers here.

**1. What must learners remember?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. Where is retrieval structured?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. Where is thinking visible?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Where is cognitive load unnecessary?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Stage 2: Diagnose misalignment

**5. Where do role decisions contradict each other?** List at least two.

|Contradiction|Roles involved|
|-------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

&nbsp;

**6. Which contradiction most impairs learning, and why?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**This is your redesign focus for Phase 5.**

## Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign

### Learning Experience Redesign Map

Complete each section as a team. Write directly in this workbook or on the printed template.

---

#### 1. Capability Object

**What must learners be able to do 6 to 12 months after this experience, in real conditions?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What cognitive change is required?** (What must change in their schemas, judgment or mental models?)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### 2. Retrieval Points

**Where and when is this knowledge retrieved after initial learning?**

| Retrieval point | Timing | Mechanism |
|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

&nbsp;

---

#### 3. Visible Reasoning

**What prompts or tasks require learners to externalise their thinking?** (Not just produce a correct answer, but show their reasoning.)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### 4. Load Reduction

**What extraneous elements were removed or simplified?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What decisions were made to protect working memory capacity?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### 5. Media Justification

For each significant media element in the redesign, state its cognitive function.

| Media element | Cognitive function it serves |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### 6. Platform Alignment

**How does the technology enable the design?** Name specific affordances.

**What memory structures are strengthened by this redesign?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Where is retrieval embedded, and at what intervals?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Review at least two redesigns and leave three sticky notes on each: green (strength), yellow (tension), blue (question).

**Team 1 — Strength (green):**

&nbsp;

**Team 1 — Tension (yellow):**

&nbsp;

**Team 1 — Question (blue):**

&nbsp;

---

**Team 2 — Strength (green):**

&nbsp;

**Team 2 — Tension (yellow):**

&nbsp;

**Team 2 — Question (blue):**

&nbsp;

---

### Feedback I received

After the gallery walk, read the sticky notes on your team's redesign map and note the most useful responses.

**Most useful strength:**

&nbsp;

**Most useful tension:**

&nbsp;

**Most important question to resolve:**

&nbsp;

---

## Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter

### Individual commitments

Write each commitment before sharing with the group.

**One decision I will no longer make alone:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**One role I need earlier in the design process:**

&nbsp;

**Why earlier involvement by that role would improve the learning outcome:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**One learning science principle I will use in future design discussions:**

&nbsp;

**One process change we will implement in the next design cycle:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### 30-day follow-up plan

Record the details of your follow-up commitment.

**Follow-up session date:**

**Who will attend:**

**What I will bring:**
1. One decision I made differently since the workshop
2. One place where collaboration improved
3. One remaining misalignment that needs addressing

**Notes on what I want to track between now and then:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### Closing retrieval task

Without notes, write three things.

**How I now define learning:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**One way my role mediates cognitive change:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**One collaboration commitment I am taking forward:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Reference: The Three Learning Science Commitments

Keep this page accessible. Use it as your arbitration language when making design decisions.

---

### 1. Memory precedes complex thinking

Higher-order cognitive operations require accessible knowledge structures in long-term memory. You cannot analyse, evaluate or create with knowledge you cannot recall.

**Design implication:** Sequence instruction so foundational knowledge is encoded and retrievable before learners are asked to apply it in complex ways.

---

### 2. Retrieval strengthens memory

Actively recalling information from memory strengthens the neural pathways that make future recall easier. Re-reading or re-watching does not produce the same effect.

**Design implication:** Build retrieval opportunities into the design with specific timing, mechanisms and spacing. Retrieval is not a test event — it is an instructional strategy.

---

### 3. Cognitive load must be managed

Working memory is limited. Extraneous cognitive load (effort not contributing to schema formation) reduces the capacity available for learning. Complexity and novelty must be introduced deliberately, not simultaneously.

**Design implication:** Remove presentation elements that do not serve the learning objective. Manage the number of new concepts introduced at once. Use worked examples before asking learners to solve problems independently.

---

## Reference: Role Contributions to the Activity System

Each role mediates learning differently. The table below summarises how each role contributes to durable learner capability.

| Role | Primary contribution | Key learning science responsibility |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Curriculum Design | Programme-level sequencing and outcome coherence | Ensuring foundational knowledge precedes complex application across the programme |
| Learning or Experience Design | Instructional strategy and cognitive engagement | Structuring retrieval, visible reasoning and appropriate challenge |
| Multimedia Design | Cognitive representation through media | Reducing extraneous load and supporting schema formation through appropriate representation |
| Learning Technology | Platform affordances for retrieval, feedback and collaboration | Ensuring the platform enables rather than constrains pedagogical intent |
