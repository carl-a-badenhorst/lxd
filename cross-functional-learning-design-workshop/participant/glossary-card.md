# Glossary Card
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

*Keep this card during the workshop. Use it as a shared reference point when language becomes contested.*

## The operational definition

> **Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.**

This definition is the arbitration point throughout the session. If a design decision cannot be connected to durable cognitive change, it is optimising for activity completion, not learning.

---

## Key terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Schema** | Organised knowledge structures in long-term memory. Schemas connect individual facts into meaningful patterns that can be retrieved and applied. |
| **Retrieval** | Actively recalling information from memory. Not re-reading, not re-watching — attempting to reconstruct knowledge without consulting the source. |
| **Cognitive load** | The mental effort required during a learning activity. Working memory is limited; how that capacity is spent determines whether schema formation occurs. |
| **Extraneous load** | Effort that does not contribute to schema formation. Sources include: confusing navigation, irrelevant content, unnecessary visual complexity, poorly organised information. Extraneous load competes with learning. |
| **Germane load** | Effort that builds understanding. Sources include: connecting new knowledge to existing schemas, applying concepts to problems, resolving well-designed challenges. Germane load is the load worth keeping. |
| **Object of design** | The shared cognitive outcome all roles are working toward: the durable capability learners must demonstrate 6 to 12 months after instruction. |
| **Activity system** | A social structure where multiple roles coordinate tools, rules and artefacts toward a shared outcome. In this workshop, the shared outcome is durable learner capability. |
| **Durable capability** | The ability to perform competently in real conditions, 6 to 12 months after a learning experience, without the support of the original instruction. |

## The three learning science commitments

| # | Commitment | Design implication |
|---|------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Memory precedes complex thinking** — You cannot think critically about what you do not remember. Higher-order operations require accessible schemas in long-term memory. | Build schemas before requiring application. Instruction that asks learners to evaluate, analyse or synthesise before they have consolidated relevant knowledge produces surface performance, not durable capability. |
| 2 | **Retrieval strengthens memory** — Actively recalling information from memory strengthens retention more than re-reading or re-watching the same material. | Embed retrieval practice into the learning experience. Retrieval is not just a measurement tool; it is a learning event. Two retrieval moments per module is the minimum. |
| 3 | **Cognitive load must be managed** — Working memory is limited. Extraneous load competes with schema formation and reduces what the learner can process. | Simplify. Remove elements that do not serve cognition. Organise information clearly. Every extraneous element is a tax on learning capacity. |

## Role contributions to the activity system

| Role | Primary contribution | Key question |
|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Curriculum Design** | Sequences knowledge across time; ensures programme-level coherence | Where is knowledge reinforced over time? Where is sequencing designed to support transfer? |
| **Learning / Experience Design** | Structures cognitive operations learners must practise | What must learners think through? Where is retrieval embedded? Where is reasoning externalised? |
| **Multimedia Design** | Selects and designs media to support schema formation | What cognitive function does each media element serve? Where does media increase or reduce load? |
| **Learning Technology** | Configures platform affordances to enable designed pedagogy | What does the platform allow? Where does it constrain? What analytics can inform iteration? |

## The diagnostic norm

> *"We are diagnosing the system, not individuals. Misalignment is structural, not personal. Our goal is coherence, not blame."*

Return to this norm whenever diagnosis in Phase 4 becomes personal.

## What you are building in Phase 5

A **Learning Experience Redesign Map** with seven required sections:

1. Capability Object — the durable performance, not the activity
2. Retrieval Points — at least two distinct retrieval moments
3. Visible Reasoning — prompts that externalise thinking
4. Load Reduction — extraneous elements removed
5. Media Justification — every medium justified by cognitive function
6. Platform Alignment — technology enabling the design
7. Connection to Programme — how this module builds programme-level capability

Plus: a **Learning Science Justification** naming which commitment each design decision applies and why.
