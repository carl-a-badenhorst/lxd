# Learning Experience Redesign Map
## Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign Template

**Workshop:** Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

## How to use this template

Complete each section as a team using sticky notes (digital or physical) or writing directly in the spaces provided. Every section must be completed. The Learning Science Justification is required before presenting your map in the gallery walk.

Your redesign must demonstrate a clear shift from activity completion toward durable learner capability. Use the operational definition of learning as your reference point throughout:

> *Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.*

---

## 1. Capability Object

*What must learners be able to do 6–12 months after this module, in real conditions? What cognitive change must occur for that to be possible?*

**Capability statement** (one or two sentences describing the durable performance):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Cognitive change required** (what must shift in long-term memory for that performance to be possible):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## 2. Retrieval Points

*Where and when is knowledge retrieved after initial learning? At minimum, identify two distinct retrieval moments.*

**Retrieval point 1**
- When: 
- How (format or prompt): 
- What knowledge is retrieved: 

**Retrieval point 2**
- When: 
- How (format or prompt): 
- What knowledge is retrieved: 

**Additional retrieval points** (if applicable):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## 3. Visible Reasoning

*What prompts or tasks require learners to externalise their thinking — to make cognition visible rather than private?*

**Prompt or task 1:**

&nbsp;

**Prompt or task 2:**

&nbsp;

**How does this evidence thinking, not just output?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## 4. Load Reduction

*What extraneous elements were removed or simplified? Extraneous load is effort that does not contribute to schema formation.*

| Element | Change made | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**What remains that is necessary germane load** (effort that builds understanding)?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

## 5. Media Justification

*What cognitive function does each medium or modality serve? Every media element must be justified by its contribution to learning, not by convention or visual appeal.*

| Medium or modality | Cognitive function | Removed or retained? |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Is any medium doing work that a simpler format could do equally well?**

&nbsp;

---

## 6. Platform Alignment

*How does the technology platform enable the redesigned learning experience? Where does the platform need to do something it currently cannot?*

**What the platform now enables:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Platform constraints or gaps** (what the platform cannot do that the design requires):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Workaround or advocacy needed** (if any):

&nbsp;

---

## 7. Connection to Programme

*How does this module contribute to programme-level capability? How does it reinforce, extend, or prepare for capability addressed elsewhere in the programme?*

**Programme-level outcome this module serves:**

&nbsp;

**How this module builds toward or reinforces it:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Knowledge or capability assumed on entry:**

&nbsp;

**Knowledge or capability passed forward to subsequent modules:**

&nbsp;

---

## Learning Science Justification

*Required. Complete this section before presenting at the gallery walk. Be specific: name the commitment, identify the exact design decision that applies it, and explain the reasoning.*

**Memory structures strengthened:**

Which schemas in long-term memory does this redesign build or reinforce? How?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Retrieval embedded at:**

Identify the specific moments and formats where retrieval practice occurs. Distinguish retrieval from re-reading or re-watching.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Cognitive load decisions:**

What extraneous load was removed? What germane load was preserved or added? What evidence supports those decisions?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Completion checklist

Before presenting your map in the gallery walk, confirm:

- [ ] A clear capability object is stated — durable performance, not activity completion
- [ ] At least two distinct retrieval points are identified with format and timing
- [ ] At least one visible reasoning prompt is included
- [ ] At least one extraneous load reduction is specified and justified
- [ ] Every media element is justified by its cognitive function
- [ ] Platform affordances and constraints are addressed
- [ ] Connection to programme-level outcomes is stated
- [ ] Learning Science Justification is complete with specific examples for all three prompts

## Gallery walk feedback

*To be completed by reviewing teams during Phase 6.*

**Team name (reviewer):**

**Strength** — What aligns well with learning science? Name the commitment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Tension** — Where might the design impair learning? Name the commitment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Clarification question** — What needs more explanation?

&nbsp;
