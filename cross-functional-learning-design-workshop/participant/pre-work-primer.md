# Pre-Work Primer
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

**Please complete this before the workshop. It takes approximately 20 minutes.**

## Why this primer matters

This workshop is not a content session. It is a design methodology session that uses your real work as material.

The session moves fast. Phase 2 opens with a retrieval task — you will be asked to write the three learning science commitments from memory, without notes. If you have not read this primer, you will have nothing to retrieve.

More importantly: the session assumes everyone is working from the same operational definition of learning. If that baseline is not shared, the diagnosis activities and the redesign work in Phases 4 and 5 cannot function as intended.

Twenty minutes of reading now produces a significantly better 135-minute session.

## What learning is

Most working definitions of learning describe activity: the learner watched, completed, attended, submitted. Activity is what we hope causes learning. It is not learning itself.

**Working definition for this workshop:**

> Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.

Three words in that definition do most of the work:

**Durable.** Learning is not visible minutes after a session. It is visible months later, when a learner applies something in conditions the original instruction did not specifically prepare them for. If the capability disappears within weeks, no learning occurred — only temporary performance.

**Knowledge structures.** Learning changes how knowledge is organised in long-term memory. Isolated facts, disconnected from other knowledge, are fragile. Organised schemas — networks of connected, meaningful knowledge — are durable and transferable.

**Enables future.** The test of learning is not what a learner can do during or immediately after instruction. It is what they can do 6 to 12 months later, in real conditions, when the facilitator, the slides and the quiz are long gone.

**Implication for your role:** Every design decision you make — a curriculum sequence, an instructional activity, a media choice, a platform affordance — either increases or decreases the probability of that durable change. This workshop is about making those decisions deliberately and collectively.

## Three learning science commitments

**Please watch this 8-minute video before attending.**

[Link to video: Introduction to Learning Science Commitments]

The video introduces the three commitments below. Read them here as well. You will be asked to recall them from memory in Phase 2 of the workshop.

---

### Commitment 1: Memory precedes complex thinking

You cannot think critically about what you do not remember.

Higher-order cognitive operations — analysis, evaluation, application, synthesis — require accessible knowledge structures in long-term memory. A learner who does not have a working schema for a concept cannot evaluate it; they can only respond to the surface features of a question.

**Design implication:** Activities that require complex thinking before the relevant knowledge is consolidated will produce the appearance of learning during the session and little or no learning months later. Schema must be built before it is applied.

**Example:** Asking participants to evaluate ethical frameworks in an assessment while their only instruction was a 20-minute lecture on definitions. Evaluation demands schema application; a lecture on definitions builds recognition memory at best.

---

### Commitment 2: Retrieval strengthens memory

Re-reading and re-watching produce familiarity. Retrieval produces learning.

Actively recalling information from memory — attempting to reconstruct it without looking at the source — strengthens the neural pathways that make future recall easier. This is the testing effect: the act of retrieval is itself a learning event, not merely a measurement of prior learning.

**Design implication:** Learners who re-read content feel prepared. Learners who practise retrieval are prepared. Retrieval practice must be designed into learning experiences, not added as an optional quiz at the end.

**Example:** Asking participants to write the three commitments from memory (as you will do in Phase 2) produces more durable retention than asking them to re-read this primer before the session.

### Commitment 3: Cognitive load must be managed

Working memory is limited. When it is overwhelmed, schema formation stops.

Cognitive load is the mental effort required during learning. It has two components relevant to design:

- **Extraneous load:** Effort that does not contribute to schema formation — confusing navigation, unnecessary visual complexity, poorly organised information, irrelevant content. This load competes with learning.
- **Germane load:** Effort that builds understanding — making connections, applying concepts, resolving carefully designed challenges. This load produces learning.

**Design implication:** Every element in a learning experience that imposes extraneous load reduces the working memory capacity available for schema formation. Simplify where possible. Organise information clearly. Remove elements that do not serve cognition.

**Example:** A slide with twelve bullet points, decorative imagery and three-column layout imposes extraneous load before the learner has even begun processing the content. The same information, chunked across three slides with clear hierarchy, reduces extraneous load significantly.

## Shared glossary

These terms will be used consistently throughout the workshop. Familiarise yourself with them now.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Schema** | Organised knowledge structures in long-term memory |
| **Retrieval** | Actively recalling information from memory — not re-reading or re-watching |
| **Cognitive load** | The mental effort required during learning |
| **Extraneous load** | Effort that does not contribute to schema formation |
| **Germane load** | Effort that builds understanding |
| **Object of design** | The shared cognitive outcome all roles are working toward |
| **Activity system** | A social structure where multiple roles coordinate tools, rules and artefacts toward a shared outcome |
| **Durable capability** | The ability to perform competently in real conditions, 6 to 12 months after a learning experience |

## Reflect on your role before attending

These questions are for individual reflection only. You do not need to write a formal response. Consider them in the days before the workshop.

**What decisions does your role typically make?**
Think about a recent project. What did you decide? When in the process did you make those decisions? Who was consulted?

**Where do those decisions affect cognition?**
Which of your decisions determine what learners must remember, think about, or apply? Which decisions affect how much mental effort the experience requires?

**Where have cross-role tensions emerged?**
Think of a recent moment where your role's priorities conflicted with another role's. What caused the tension? What was the impact on the learning experience?

**Where might learning science help?**
Looking at the three commitments above: where in your recent work has one of these commitments been violated? What would have needed to change for it to be applied?

---

## Bring to the workshop

You will need these in Phase 4 (cross-role diagnosis) and Phase 5 (collaborative redesign).

- **One module or assessment artefact** — printed or open on a device. This should be something you have worked on recently, not an idealised example.
- **Programme-level outcomes** — the document that describes what learners should be able to do upon completing the programme this module belongs to. A one-page summary is sufficient.
- **A brief description of one cross-role misalignment you have experienced** — two or three sentences describing a situation where roles pulled in different directions and the learning experience suffered for it.

If you do not have access to a real artefact, the workshop facilitator will provide a sample for your team to analyse.

## Design logic of this primer

This primer is itself an example of the commitments it describes.

You are reading it 5 to 7 days before the session — not the morning of — because spaced exposure increases retention. You will be asked to retrieve the three commitments from memory in Phase 2, not re-read them; this strengthens recall. The content is structured in a hierarchy that reduces extraneous load (one concept per section, definitions before implications, examples after both). And you are being asked to reflect on your own role before the session begins, because that reflection activates prior knowledge and prepares cognitive structure for new connections.

Notice these choices. They are the same choices you will be making about your own learners in Phase 5.
