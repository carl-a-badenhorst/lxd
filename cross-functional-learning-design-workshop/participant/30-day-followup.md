# 30-Day Follow-Up Session
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Format:** Same group as the original workshop

---

## Purpose

This session reinforces what you applied from the workshop and surfaces where the system still needs work. It is not a debrief. It is an accountability check-in.

The question is not "What did you remember?" The question is "What did you do differently — and what happened?"

---

## Before the session

**Bring the following:**

1. **Your Phase 7 commitments** — the four things you wrote in the collaboration charter:
   - One decision you said you would no longer make alone
   - One role you said you needed earlier in the design process
   - One learning science principle you committed to applying
   - One process change your team was going to implement

2. **One concrete example** — a design decision you made, an activity you redesigned, a conversation you had differently, or a process change you initiated. It does not need to be large. It needs to be real.

3. **One remaining misalignment** — something that has not changed, a structural barrier you encountered, or a place where the system still resists the commitments you made.

If you cannot identify a single example of acting differently, that is useful information. Bring it.

## Session agenda

### Part A — Individual share-outs (20 minutes)

Each role group shares in turn. **5 minutes per group.** Keep to time.

For each group, share:

**1. One decision you made differently**

Describe the decision, the context, and what you changed. Be specific. "I thought more carefully about retrieval" is not a decision. "I added a structured recall task at the start of week 3 that asked learners to write three key concepts from memory before viewing the worked example" is a decision.

**2. One place where collaboration improved**

Identify a specific moment or project where the shared language or the cross-role commitments from the workshop changed how your team worked. What was different? What produced it?

**3. One remaining misalignment that needs addressing**

Name something that still is not working. Be direct. The purpose of this session is not to report success; it is to identify what still needs structural change.

---

### Part B — System-level reflection (10 minutes)

After all role groups have shared, the group reflects together on three questions:

**1. Which process changes have been implemented?**

List what has actually changed — not what was intended. What is different in how roles collaborate, how design decisions are made, how learning science is applied?

**2. What structural barriers remain?**

Identify the systemic issues that individual commitments cannot resolve: technology constraints, workflow structures, timeline pressures, decision-making processes, leadership expectations. These require organisational intervention, not individual effort.

**3. What additional support is needed?**

Be specific about what would need to change at the system level for the commitments from the workshop to become standard practice rather than exceptional effort.

---

## After the session

**If issues raised require leadership action:** The facilitator will document systemic barriers and escalate to the relevant decision-makers. Your job is to name the barriers clearly; the facilitator's job is to carry them forward.

**If a second check-in is needed:** A 30-minute check-in at 60 or 90 days follows the same structure. The facilitator will schedule it before this session ends if the group agrees it is needed.

**Your Redesign Map:** The map you built in Phase 5 is a prototype. Bring it to the next project you work on. Use it as a diagnostic tool. Notice where the seven sections force different conversations than your current process produces.

## Reference: your Phase 7 commitments

*Transfer from your workbook before attending.*

| Prompt | What I wrote |
|--------|-------------|
| One decision I will no longer make alone | |
| One role I need earlier in the design process | |
| One learning science principle I will use in future discussions | |
| One process change we will implement in the next design cycle | |

## Reference: the three learning science commitments

| Commitment | What it means for your work |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Memory precedes complex thinking | Schema must be built before learners are asked to apply, evaluate or synthesise |
| Retrieval strengthens memory | Retrieval practice must be embedded — not added as an end-of-module quiz |
| Cognitive load must be managed | Remove extraneous elements; preserve germane load; simplify wherever cognition is not served |
