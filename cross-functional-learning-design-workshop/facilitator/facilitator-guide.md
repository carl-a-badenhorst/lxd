# Facilitator Guide
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

---

## Using This Guide

This guide supports the facilitator who leads the 135-minute workshop. It provides phase-by-phase facilitation notes, scripted transitions, anticipated resistance points and guidance for common participant responses. Read it alongside the workshop outline, which contains the full agenda, activities and artefacts.

**What this guide does not include:** slide-by-slide instructions or full activity content. Those appear in the workshop outline. This guide focuses on how to facilitate, not what to deliver.

## Facilitator Mindset

### Your role in this workshop

You are not a lecturer. Your job is to hold a productive tension between challenge and support: push participants to think rigorously about learning science while making it safe to name real cross-role dysfunction.

The workshop surfaces structural misalignment. Participants may arrive with fixed role identities and unresolved interpersonal friction. Your task is to redirect that friction toward the shared object, defined as durable learner capability, and keep it there.

### What this workshop is not

This is not a team-building session. It is not a content training. It is a design methodology session that uses real work as material. Participants should leave with a changed cognitive model and a concrete redesign artefact, not a warm feeling about their colleagues.

### The diagnostic norm — return to this repeatedly

Establish this norm in the opening and restate it whenever tension rises:

> "We're diagnosing the system, not individuals. Misalignment is structural, not personal. Our goal is coherence, not blame."

---

## Before the Workshop

### Pre-work verification

The workshop assumes participants completed the pre-work primer sent 5 to 7 days in advance. This primer introduced the operational definition of learning and three learning science commitments.

Before Phase 2 begins, you need to know how many participants actually completed it. A quick show of hands in the first two minutes is sufficient. If fewer than half completed it, adjust Phase 2 as follows:

- Add 5 minutes of direct instruction in Phase 2 before the recall task
- State the three commitments on a visible surface (whiteboard, slide or FigJam)
- Do not skip the recall task: participants who read last night still benefit from retrieval practice

If almost no one completed the pre-work, do not reschedule. Use the worked example in Phase 2C as the primary introduction and compress Phase 2A to a "best attempt" framing:

> "Write what you think the three commitments might be, even if you're guessing. We'll correct from there."

### Room and materials setup

Arrive 30 minutes before the session. Configure as follows:

**Physical delivery:**
- Tables arranged in groups of 4 to 5 mixed-role participants (pre-assign groups)
- Wall space for Phase 6 gallery walk (tape or rails)
- Sticky notes: green, yellow and blue at each table
- Printed redesign map templates, one per group plus two spares
- Printed pre-work glossary cards, one per participant
- Blank paper or a notebook at each seat for Phase 1 and 2A

**Digital or hybrid delivery:**
- FigJam board open and shared before participants arrive
- Redesign Map template copied once per team (pre-duplicate)
- Breakout rooms pre-configured for Phase 3 role groups and Phase 4 mixed teams
- Sticky note colors set in FigJam: green (strength), yellow (tension), blue (question)
- Test audio and video on all devices before participants join

### Pre-assigning teams

Assign mixed-role teams for Phases 4 and 5 before the workshop. Each team should include:
- One person from Curriculum Design or close equivalent
- One person from Learning or Experience Design
- One person from Multimedia Design
- One person from Learning Technology

If your group does not have all four roles, distribute participants so that each team includes at least two different role perspectives. Avoid teams where one role dominates.

Write team assignments on cards or post them digitally. Do not announce teams in advance. Reveal them at the start of Phase 4 to avoid participants clustering socially before cross-role work begins.

## Phase-by-Phase Facilitation Notes

---

### Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object (0–15 min)

**Purpose:** Surface existing mental models of learning and replace them with an operational definition rooted in durable cognitive change.

**Facilitation approach:**

Open without a lengthy introduction. Do not introduce yourself at length, explain the workshop goals or give a background presentation. Start with the writing task immediately.

Say:

> "Before we do anything else, I want you to write two things. First: define learning in one sentence. Second: how do you know when learning has happened? Take 90 seconds. Write, don't type."

After writing, ask for two or three volunteers to read their definitions aloud. Do not evaluate or affirm them beyond "thank you." Write one or two key words from each definition on the whiteboard.

Then say:

> "Most of these definitions describe activity: completing a course, watching content, attending a session. That's not learning. That's participation. Learning is something the activity is meant to cause."

Introduce the operational definition:

> **Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.**

Ask participants to underline or circle the words that are doing the most work: durable, knowledge structures and enables future performance.

Then move to the second prompt:

> "Based on this definition, ask yourself: what must learners be able to do 6 to 12 months after this module, in the real conditions of their work? And what cognitive change must occur for that to be possible?"

Give 3 minutes for individual writing, then briefly take two or three responses from different roles. Do not debrief these in depth. The goal is to surface the capability focus, not to evaluate current practice.

**Common responses and how to handle them:**

*"But we don't own the outcomes — the client does."*
> "That's a real constraint. It doesn't change the question. If you're designing learning, you need to know what capability you're designing for, even if you didn't write the outcome. Phase 4 will show you what happens when roles don't know each other's answers to this question."

*"Our modules are standalone. There's no programme."*
> "Even standalone modules have a capability object. A single module either builds a transferable skill or it doesn't. Your job is to design for which."

**What to watch for:**

Some participants will conflate engagement with learning. If you hear "I know learning happened when participants say they enjoyed it" or "when they complete the quiz," name the distinction clearly:

> "Engagement and completion are proxies. They're useful but not sufficient. A learner can complete every activity and retain nothing three weeks later. We design for the version of them that exists six months from now."

**Time check:** Phase 1 should end by the 15-minute mark. If it runs long, cut the number of shared responses, not the writing time.

---

### Phase 2 — Learning Science Core (15–30 min)

**Purpose:** Activate prior learning from the pre-work through retrieval practice and connect the three commitments to specific design decisions.

**Part A: Recall task (15–20 min, 5 min duration)**

Say:

> "Close your notes. Without looking, write the three learning science commitments from the pre-work. You have two minutes."

Do not prompt or hint. Silence is productive here. After two minutes, reveal the three commitments on the whiteboard or a shared screen.

Ask for a show of hands:
- "Who got all three?" 
- "Who got two?" 
- "Who got one or fewer?"

If many participants got zero or one, say:

> "That's useful information. You just experienced the thing we're designing against. You read it recently — but retrieval is harder than recognition. This is why the design choices we make in Phases 4 and 5 matter."

Do not dwell. Move to Part B.

**Part B: Role-based application (20–30 min, 10 min duration)**

Participants regroup with others from the same role. Each group discusses:
- Where is retrieval structured in your typical work?
- Where might cognitive load be excessive?
- Where is thinking hidden?

Circulate during this discussion. Listen for participants applying the commitments accurately and for those who treat them as abstract principles without connecting them to specific design artefacts.

Redirect vague answers with:
> "Give me a specific artefact. A specific module or assessment. Where in that does retrieval happen? Or where does it not?"

**Part C: Worked example (25–30 min, 5 min duration)**

Present the worked example directly, without framing it as a quiz:

> "Here's a real alignment failure. The module outcome is: 'Evaluate ethical frameworks.' The assessment is: a multiple-choice quiz on definitions."

Ask:
> "What's the misalignment?"

Take two responses. Then state the diagnosis clearly:

> "Evaluation requires applying a schema to a novel situation. Multiple-choice recognition tests recall of labels, not application of frameworks. You've assessed memory without testing whether it leads to judgment. That's the gap."

This example sets the diagnostic schema that teams will use in Phase 4. Do not rush past it.

**What to watch for:**

Participants from Learning Technology may disengage during Part B if they feel the commitments are "about content" rather than platform design. Draw them in with:

> "Retrieval doesn't only happen in content. Where does your platform structure create or prevent retrieval? That's a platform design decision."

---

### Phase 3 — Role Mapping (30–50 min)

**Purpose:** Make role differences visible, concrete and grounded in learning science.

**Part A: Role clarification (30–45 min, 15 min duration)**

Participants regroup by role. Each group works through the prompts for their role (in the workshop outline, page 3).

Your task during this phase is to move between groups and ensure discussions stay grounded in learning science rather than becoming a defense of current practice.

Listen for the following patterns and redirect if you hear them:

*"We already do this."*
> "Great. Point to a specific moment in a specific design where that's visible. If you can't point to it, it's not a commitment — it's an aspiration."

*"This isn't really our responsibility."*
> "Tell me whose responsibility it is. If no role owns it, it falls through a gap. That's exactly what we're going to diagnose in Phase 4."

*"Our tools don't allow for this."*
> "Good. Write that down. In Phase 5, you'll either redesign around the constraint or flag that the constraint needs advocacy."

**Part B: Cross-role perspective taking (45–50 min, 5 min duration)**

Pair each participant with someone from a different role. Give clear instructions:

> "One of you describes a real design decision you made recently. The other identifies which learning science commitment it serves — or violates. Be specific. You have two minutes per person."

Circulate and listen. Use what you hear to identify one strong example and one revealing misalignment to reference briefly in the transition to Phase 4.

**Transition to Phase 4 (2 min bridge):**

Before moving on, say:

> "You've just seen your role from two directions: from inside, through the role prompts, and from outside, through your partner's perspective. In Phase 4, we're going to combine those perspectives and look at real work together. The question shifts from 'what does my role do?' to 'where is the system failing the learner?'"

Then reveal mixed-role team assignments.

---

### Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis (50–75 min)

**Purpose:** Apply learning science as a shared diagnostic lens to real design artefacts, and produce a specific misalignment to address in redesign.

**Framing the transition:**

Before teams begin, state the diagnostic norm again:

> "We're diagnosing the system, not individuals. Misalignment is structural, not personal. Our goal is coherence, not blame."

Then direct teams to the artefact they brought:

> "Each team: choose one artefact to work with. Ideally choose the most complex or problematic one you have. That's where the diagnosis will be richest."

**Stage 1 — Identify (50–55 min, 5 min duration)**

Teams work through four questions:
1. What must learners remember?
2. Where is retrieval structured?
3. Where is thinking visible?
4. Where is cognitive load unnecessary?

Remind teams that these are not rhetorical questions. They should point to specific elements in the artefact.

**Stage 2 — Diagnose misalignment (55–75 min, 20 min duration)**

Teams work through two further questions:
5. Where do role decisions contradict each other?
6. Which contradictions most impair learning?

Circulate actively. The richest diagnosis often appears in the gap between what was intended by one role and what was delivered by another. Surface that:

> "Curriculum Design wrote this outcome. Learning Design built this activity. Does the activity give learners practice at the cognitive operation named in the outcome?"

**Intervention for teams that stay surface-level:**

Some teams will name misalignments in general terms: "the content is too dense" or "we need better media." Push for the structural cause:

> "Density is a symptom. What decision caused it? Who made it, and based on what? Where in the workflow did the cognitive load analysis get dropped?"

**Intervention for teams with no artefact:**

If a team did not bring an artefact, give them the sample module below. Use this only as fallback.

> **Sample artefact for diagnosis:**
> - Programme outcome: "Apply risk frameworks to operational decisions"
> - Module: 45-minute video lecture with narrated slides
> - Assessment: Scenario-based reflection submitted 2 weeks later
> - Media: Dense slide decks, no worked examples, no retrieval points
> - Platform: LMS with video playback and text submission only

**Time check:** Teams should have a diagnosis in hand before the break. If teams are still in Stage 1 at the 60-minute mark, prompt them to move to Stage 2 immediately.

---

### Break (75–85 min)

Use the break to:
- Review what you observed in Phase 4 and note two or three patterns to reference after the break
- Check that teams have their redesign map templates ready
- Confirm digital spaces or wall areas are set up for Phase 6

After the break, open Phase 5 with the bridge statement:

> "Based on your diagnosis, identify the one misalignment most blocking learning. That's your redesign focus. Not all of them — the one. Start there."

---

### Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign (85–110 min)

**Purpose:** Translate the diagnosis into a coherent, learning-science-grounded redesign artefact.

**Setting up the redesign map:**

Distribute the redesign map template (FigJam or printed). Walk through the seven sections briefly — do not explain each field in detail. Teams should explore the template as they use it.

Say:

> "Your redesign does not need to be complete. It needs to be coherent. Seven sections that hang together around a clear capability object is worth more than fifty disconnected improvements."

**What good redesign looks like:**

Monitor for these markers:
- The capability object is concrete and time-referenced (e.g. "identify regulatory risk in project proposals during the first 90 days")
- Retrieval points are named with specific timing and mechanism (e.g. "spaced retrieval quiz 48 hours after module, then 14 days later")
- Media justifications name a cognitive function, not a format preference
- Platform affordances are connected to specific pedagogical purposes

**Common redesign errors and how to address them:**

*Adding activities without removing load:*
> "You've added a retrieval point. What did you remove? Adding complexity without removing extraneous load increases total cognitive effort. What's less important than what you've added?"

*Capability object is too vague:*
> "Can you test this? If I gave a learner this capability object and asked them to demonstrate it, would you know when they'd succeeded? If not, make it more specific."

*Media section defaults to format preferences:*
> "You've written 'short video.' What cognitive function does video serve here that text wouldn't? If the answer is 'it's more engaging,' that's not a cognitive justification."

*Technology section lists platform features rather than affordances:*
> "You've written 'use the discussion forum.' How does the discussion forum structure retrieval, feedback or visible reasoning? What would you need the platform to do that it currently doesn't?"

**The learning science justification section:**

Ensure every team completes this section. It is not a summary — it is a test of alignment. If a team cannot state which memory structures are strengthened, where retrieval is embedded and what cognitive load decisions were made, the redesign is not grounded in learning science yet.

Push teams to complete this section before the gallery walk.

**Time check:** Teams should have a completed or near-complete map by the 108-minute mark. Two minutes before Phase 6 begins, say:

> "Finish your current section. You'll get peer feedback in the gallery walk — that feedback is data for a second pass, not an evaluation of your work."

---

### Phase 6 — Cross-Team Critique (110–125 min)

**Purpose:** Provide structured peer feedback grounded in learning science to strengthen each redesign.

**Setting up the gallery walk:**

For physical delivery: Teams post their redesign maps on the wall. Each reviewer takes a set of sticky notes (green, yellow, blue) and moves to a different team's map.

For digital delivery: Each team's FigJam section is visible to all. Reviewers add sticky notes to sections that are not their own team's.

**Give reviewers the protocol clearly before they move:**

> "For each redesign you review, leave three sticky notes. Green: one strength — something that aligns well with learning science. Yellow: one tension — a place where the design might impair learning. Blue: one clarification question — something that needs more explanation. Three notes. Every reviewer, every redesign."

Circulate during the gallery walk. Ensure feedback is grounded in learning science, not personal preference. If you see a yellow note that says "this seems complicated," prompt the reviewer:

> "Which learning science commitment does your concern connect to? Write that on the sticky note."

**After the gallery walk:**

Give teams 3 minutes to read the feedback on their own map. No discussion with reviewers yet — that happens informally during Phase 7 or after the session. The review is data.

---

### Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter and Closing (125–135 min)

**Purpose:** Convert individual insight into concrete, accountable collective commitment.

**Part A: Individual commitments (125–130 min, 5 min duration)**

Ask participants to write their four commitment statements individually before sharing. Writing first prevents social anchoring (where participants copy the most confident voice in the room).

After 3 minutes of writing, take one or two responses from different roles for each prompt. Do not collect these in writing unless you have a digital form. They are for individual accountability, not group reporting.

**Part B: 30-day follow-up plan (130–133 min, 3 min duration)**

State the follow-up protocol clearly and directly:

> "In 4 weeks, we'll meet for 30 minutes. Each role will share three things: one decision you made differently, one place where collaboration improved, and one remaining misalignment. Calendar invitations go out today. This isn't optional."

Send calendar invitations before participants leave the room. If you cannot send them live, have a coordinator send them within two hours of the session ending.

**Part C: Closing retrieval task (133–135 min, 5 min duration, allow spillover)**

This is the most important moment in the workshop from a learning science perspective. Participants must retrieve without notes.

Say:

> "Final task. No notes, no looking back. Write three things: how you now define learning, one way your role mediates cognitive change and one collaboration commitment you're taking forward. Two minutes."

Do not ask for responses. This is a private retrieval practice task, not a share-out.

Close with:

> "The map you built today is a prototype. It is not finished. What matters is that you now have a shared language, a shared diagnostic method and a first-pass artefact to iterate on. The 30-day check-in is where we find out what stuck."

---

## Managing Difficult Dynamics

### The expert who already knows everything

A participant (often senior) may signal early that these concepts are already familiar or that their role already practices learning science. Do not challenge them directly. Use them:

> "Great. Then in Phase 4, you'll be able to identify exactly where the alignment breaks down. That's the harder skill."

### The skeptic who questions the framework

Some participants resist the operational definition of learning or the CHAT/LITE framing. Engage the critique briefly, then redirect:

> "That's a legitimate theoretical tension. For today, let's hold the definition as a design constraint rather than a philosophical position. If the operational definition gives us a better artefact by the end, it's earned its place. If it doesn't, you'll have evidence for why not."

### The withdrawn participant

If someone is disengaged, assign them a specific role in their group activity:

> "In your group, I want you to take the role of advocate for the learner. When the group makes a design decision, your question is: 'Does the learner need to do this to develop the capability object?'"

### Interpersonal tension between roles

If existing workplace friction surfaces (common between curriculum designers and learning technologists), use the diagnostic norm:

> "That sounds like a systemic problem, not a personal one. What structural change in the workflow would prevent this from happening again? Write it down in your charter."

---

## Timing Contingency

If the session runs over in Phases 4 or 5, apply these cuts in order:

1. **Cut Phase 3B** (cross-role perspective taking) to a 1-minute verbal share-out instead of paired activity
2. **Compress Phase 6** to 10 minutes by limiting each team to one external review instead of two
3. **Shorten Phase 7A** to written-only commitments with no share-out

Do not cut:
- Phase 1 (the operational definition — it anchors everything)
- Phase 2C (the worked example — it builds the diagnostic schema)
- Phase 4 Stage 2 (misalignment diagnosis — it is the pivot point)
- Phase 7C (the closing retrieval task — it completes the retrieval practice arc)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Our platform doesn't allow for retrieval structures. What do we do?"**

> "That's a perfect example of technology constraining pedagogy. In Phase 5, your platform alignment section should name this explicitly. The redesign map should specify what you would need the platform to do and flag this as a change to advocate for."

**"Our roles work in sequence, not in parallel. How does this apply?"**

> "Even in sequential workflows, earlier roles can design with later constraints in mind. The collaboration charter should specify what information each role needs to receive from the role that works before it."

**"What if we disagree on what 'learning' means?"**

> "Use the operational definition as the arbitration point. If the learning outcome would not produce durable capability visible 6 to 12 months later, it describes activity completion, not learning. The definition is a design tool, not a philosophical claim."

**"This feels theoretical. We work in a completely different context."**

> "The three commitments are not theoretical — they are the cognitive constraints all learners operate within, regardless of context. The question in Phase 4 is not whether the science applies to your context. It is: where is your current design ignoring constraints that are already operating?"

**"What if our artefact is too early in the design process to diagnose?"**

> "Any artefact at any stage can be diagnosed. An outcome statement can be diagnosed for cognitive level. A content plan can be diagnosed for sequencing. A storyboard can be diagnosed for cognitive load. Use whatever you have."
