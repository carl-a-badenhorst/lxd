# FigJam Playbook
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

---

## What this document covers

This playbook tells you how to design, set up and run the workshop FigJam board. It covers board architecture (how to structure the space), phase-by-phase facilitation moves (what to do inside FigJam at each moment), FigJam feature guidance (which tools to use and when), and contingency responses for common technical problems.

Read this alongside the facilitator guide, which covers facilitation approach and scripted transitions. This playbook focuses on the digital environment, not the pedagogical content.

This is a standalone document. It does not assume you have read the Miro playbook.

---

## When to use a FigJam board

Use FigJam as the primary collaboration surface when:

- The workshop is delivered fully remotely (participants are not in the same room)
- The workshop is hybrid (some participants in-room, some remote)
- The workshop is in-room and you want a persistent digital artefact that participants can access after the session
- Your organisation already uses Figma for design work, making FigJam the natural shared surface

FigJam is the tool referenced in the original workshop outline (as the platform for the Redesign Map template). If your team is not already on Figma, check access requirements below before committing to FigJam for the session.

Do not use FigJam as a replacement for the printed workbook when delivering in-room to a group with limited digital fluency or unreliable device access. In that case, run the workshop with printed handouts and a physical whiteboard.

---

## Access requirements

FigJam access works differently from Miro. Understand these constraints before the session.

### Figma organisation accounts

If your organisation has a Figma plan (Professional, Organisation or Enterprise), participants with accounts in that organisation can access and edit the board by default. This is the smoothest path: no setup friction, no guest links.

### Guest access (free tier or external participants)

If participants do not have Figma accounts, share the board as an **editable guest link** (Share > Copy link, then set permissions to "Anyone with the link can edit"). Guest editors can:
- Add and edit sticky notes
- Use drawing tools, stamps and connectors
- Add text

Guest editors cannot:
- Create or rename Sections
- Access the full toolbar in all FigJam plans
- Use some plugins

Test guest access before the session. Open the board in a private browser window using the guest link to confirm editing works. If guest editing is restricted by your organisation's Figma settings, request an exemption from your Figma admin in advance.

### Free Figma accounts

Participants can create a free Figma account in under two minutes. If you expect guest link issues, send participants the following instruction in your pre-work email: "Create a free Figma account at figma.com before the session. You will need it to participate in the digital workshop board."

---

## Board architecture overview

The FigJam board is divided into nine zones, one per phase plus a landing zone, arranged left to right in session order. Each zone is a named **Section** of the infinite canvas.

```
[Landing] → [Phase 1] → [Phase 2] → [Phase 3] → [Phase 4] → [Break] → [Phase 5] → [Phase 6] → [Phase 7]
```

Each zone contains:
- A Section header with the phase number and title
- All activity surfaces for that phase (sticky note clusters, templates, prompt cards)
- Facilitator instruction cards placed at the bottom of each zone in a low-opacity grey text box (visible on the board but clearly marked as facilitator-only)

Total estimated board width: approximately 12,000 to 15,000 px at standard zoom.

---

## Setting up the board

### Timing

- **T minus 2 days:** Create the board and complete all zone setup.
- **T minus 1 day:** Duplicate the Redesign Map template once per team. Label each copy with the team name.
- **T minus 30 minutes:** Test the board with a co-facilitator or alone. Run through every zone. Confirm all sections, sticky note clusters and templates are correctly placed and accessible to an editor.
- **T minus 10 minutes:** Share the board link with participants. Do not share earlier — participants who enter the board before the workshop may displace items or read ahead.

### Creating Sections

Create each zone as a **FigJam Section** (press S or use the toolbar > Section). Sections group content visually and allow you to jump between them using the minimap or by clicking the section header.

Name each section clearly:
- Landing Zone
- Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object
- Phase 2 — Learning Science Core
- Phase 3 — Role Mapping
- Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis
- Break
- Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign
- Phase 6 — Cross-Team Critique
- Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter

Set each section's background fill:
- Active work phases: light warm grey (`#F0EDE8`) — FigJam's default off-white is too neutral; a slight warm tone is easier to read during extended screen sessions
- High-focus moments (Phase 2 recall task, Phase 7 closing retrieval task): dark (`#1A1A1A`) with white text elements

To set a section background in FigJam: click the section header, then use the fill colour in the right panel.

### Facilitator name

Set your display name to "Facilitator" before participants join. In FigJam, your name appears above your cursor. Go to the top-right avatar menu > Account settings > change your display name to "Facilitator" for the duration of the session, then restore it afterwards.

Ask participants to ensure their display name is their first name. In larger groups, add their role abbreviation: "Ali (CD)" for Curriculum Design, "Sam (LT)" for Learning Technology. This saves time during role-based activities.

---

## Colour coding by role

Use this colour scheme for sticky notes throughout the board. Brief participants on it in the landing zone.

| Role | Sticky note colour |
|------|--------------------|
| Curriculum Design | Yellow |
| Learning or Experience Design | Blue |
| Multimedia Design | Green |
| Learning Technology | Orange |

In FigJam, change a sticky note's colour by selecting it and using the colour picker in the toolbar (or right-click > Edit style). Pre-place empty sticky notes in each zone's role-specific areas using the correct colour so participants do not need to locate the colour picker themselves.

---

## Zone-by-zone setup guide

---

### Landing Zone

**Purpose:** Orient participants when they first enter the board.

**Contents:**

- Workshop title in large bold text: "Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System"
- Your name and the session date in smaller text below
- One instruction card: "Zoom out to see the full board. We will move left to right. Start here and wait for the facilitator."
- A name cluster: one sticky note per participant, pre-placed and colour-coded by role. Ask participants to find their name note and click it to confirm they can edit the board.

**Confirming edit access:** Asking participants to click their name note is a low-stakes edit test. If someone cannot click or move a note, you have a permission problem to solve in the first two minutes, before any activity depends on it.

**FigJam tip:** FigJam's default zoom behaviour can be disorienting for first-time users. After sharing the board link, stay in the landing zone and say: "If you can see a section with your name, you are in the right place. If you see a blank white canvas, press Ctrl+Shift+H (or Cmd+Shift+H on Mac) to fit the board to your screen."

---

### Phase 1 Zone — Framing the Shared Object

**Contents:**

1. **Prompt card 1A:** A text card — "Define learning in one sentence." Below it, a cluster of pre-placed sticky notes, one per participant, each with the participant's name written in small text at the bottom. Participants type into their assigned note.

2. **Prompt card 1B:** Same structure — "How do you know when learning has happened?"

3. **Operational definition reveal:** A text card containing the definition, covered by a filled dark shape (`#1A1A1A`) placed on top. You delete the covering shape when you are ready to reveal it.

   > Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.

4. **Three key words:** Three text elements arranged side by side — "Durable", "Knowledge structures", "Enables future" — each with a brief description below. Place these next to the definition card, covered by the same or separate dark shapes. Reveal after uncovering the definition.

5. **Prompt card 1C:** Two prompts with sticky note clusters below each:
   - "What must learners be able to do 6 to 12 months from now, in real conditions?"
   - "What cognitive change must occur for that to be possible?"

**FigJam tip:** During the 1A and 1B writing moments, use **Spotlight** to focus participant views on the prompt, then exit Spotlight to give participants freedom to write. Do not re-enter Spotlight during writing time — participants lose their place when their view is pulled.

---

### Phase 2 Zone — Learning Science Core

**Contents:**

1. **Recall task area:** Section background set to dark (`#1A1A1A`). A large white text element: "Close your notes. Write the three commitments from memory." One sticky note per participant, pre-placed and pre-named. No hints visible in this area.

   Place the Timer widget in the top-right corner of this sub-area. Set it to 2 minutes before the session. Start it when you give the instruction.

2. **Commitments reveal:** Three side-by-side cards, each covered by a dark shape:
   - Card 1: "Memory precedes complex thinking" — body text: "You cannot think critically about what you do not remember. Higher-order operations require accessible knowledge structures." — Design implication: "Schema must be built before application tasks."
   - Card 2: "Retrieval strengthens memory" — body text: "Actively recalling information strengthens retention more than re-reading or re-watching." — Design implication: "Retrieval practice must be embedded, not optional."
   - Card 3: "Cognitive load must be managed" — body text: "Working memory is limited. Extraneous load reduces capacity for understanding." — Design implication: "Simplify. Remove elements that do not serve cognition."

   Remove the covering shapes one at a time as you reveal each commitment.

3. **Role-based application area:** Four colour-coded columns, one per role, each with the role name as a header and three prompts below. Pre-place empty sticky notes in the correct role colour under each column.

   | Column | Prompts |
   |--------|---------|
   | Curriculum Design | Where is knowledge reinforced over time? Where is sequencing designed for transfer? Where might retrieval be added to the programme structure? |
   | Learning / Experience Design | What cognitive operations must learners practice? Where is retrieval embedded in instruction? Where is reasoning externalised? |
   | Multimedia Design | What cognitive function does each media element serve? Where does media increase extraneous load? Where does representation support schema formation? |
   | Learning Technology | What platform affordances enable retrieval, feedback and collaboration? Where does platform structure constrain pedagogy? What analytics inform iteration? |

4. **Worked example area:** Two side-by-side prompt cards:
   - "Module outcome: Evaluate ethical frameworks"
   - "Assessment: Multiple-choice quiz on definitions"

   Below these: a sticky note area labelled "What is the misalignment?" — participants add their answer before you reveal the diagnosis.

5. **Diagnosis reveal:** A text card covered by a dark shape:
   - Outcome demands: Higher-order thinking — evaluation, application, schema use
   - Assessment tests: Recognition memory — surface-level recall
   - Gap: Assessment cannot evidence the capability the outcome requires
   - Commitment violated: Memory precedes complex thinking — schema application is tested before it is built

**FigJam tip:** Use the Timer widget during the recall task. In FigJam, the timer is visible to all participants on the board. This is more reliable than a verbal countdown and reinforces the cognitive constraint of the task.

---

### Phase 3 Zone — Role Mapping

**Contents:**

1. **Role clarification area:** Four colour-coded columns with the role name as a header and the role's three prompts listed below. Pre-place empty sticky notes in each column in the correct role colour.

2. **Cross-role pairing area:** A simple two-column table or grid of paired boxes. Each box contains two labels: "Their decision" and "Which commitment does it serve or violate?" with space for one sticky note per label.

   For larger groups (more than 16), simplify to a single pairing area with a label per pair rather than a full grid.

**FigJam tip:** During the cross-role pairing activity, use **Cursor Chat** (press / on your keyboard while on the board) to send a time check to all participants: "2 minutes remaining — finish your current pair." This is less disruptive than using audio and keeps participants in the flow of the activity.

---

### Phase 4 Zone — Cross-Role Diagnosis

**Contents:**

1. **Team artefact area:** One sub-section per team (use a nested Section or a clearly bordered frame inside the Phase 4 section), labelled with the team name and colour-coded with a border matching the team's dominant role colour.

   Each team area contains:
   - A text area labelled "Your artefact: paste a screenshot, add a link, or describe it below"
   - Stage 1 and Stage 2 questions listed below the artefact area

2. **Stage 1 — Identify:** Four numbered question labels, each with a sticky note cluster below:
   - What must learners remember?
   - Where is retrieval structured?
   - Where is thinking visible?
   - Where is cognitive load unnecessary?

3. **Stage 2 — Diagnose misalignment:** Two question labels with sticky note clusters:
   - Where do role decisions contradict each other?
   - Which contradiction most impairs learning?

   Below the second question, a callout shape: "This is your redesign focus for Phase 5."

4. **Fallback artefact:** Placed below all team areas, labelled clearly as "Sample artefact — use if your team does not have one." Contents:
   - Programme outcome: "Apply risk frameworks to operational decisions"
   - Module: 45-minute video lecture with narrated slides
   - Assessment: Scenario-based reflection submitted 2 weeks later
   - Media: Dense slide decks, no worked examples, no retrieval points
   - Platform: LMS with video playback and text submission only

**FigJam tip:** During Phase 4, navigate between team sections using the minimap (bottom-right of the board). Use your named cursor to point to specific items when prompting teams. When you arrive at a team's area, type a Cursor Chat message to the group: "What's the most specific contradiction you can name?" This is less interruptive than speaking over audio and keeps teams in their work.

**FigJam tip:** During the break, navigate to each team's area and read their Stage 2 sticky notes. Identify teams with a clear single misalignment and those that are still too general. For general teams, prepare a verbal prompt for when they return: "You have five possible misalignments here. Which one, if fixed, would most change what learners can do?"

---

### Break Zone

**Contents:**

- A simple dark card: "Break — 10 minutes"
- Below it: "When you return: identify the one misalignment most blocking learning. That is your redesign focus. One misalignment. Not all of them."

---

### Phase 5 Zone — Collaborative Redesign

**Contents:**

1. **Redesign Map template:** One copy per team, each in its own sub-section labelled with the team name. Pre-duplicate the template before the session.

The template has seven labelled sections, each with sticky note space and a prompt question:

| Section | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| 1. Capability Object | What must learners do 6–12 months later? What cognitive change is required? |
| 2. Retrieval Points | Where and when is knowledge retrieved after initial learning? |
| 3. Visible Reasoning | What prompts require learners to externalise thinking? |
| 4. Load Reduction | What extraneous elements were removed or simplified? |
| 5. Media Justification | What cognitive function does each medium serve? |
| 6. Platform Alignment | How does technology enable the design? What does the platform need to do that it currently cannot? |
| 7. Connection to Programme | How does this module contribute to programme-level capability? |

Below all seven sections: a bordered text area labelled **Learning Science Justification** with three prompt lines:
- Memory structures strengthened:
- Retrieval embedded at:
- Cognitive load decisions:

**FigJam tip:** In FigJam you cannot silently follow a participant's cursor the way Miro's Follow mode works. Instead, use the minimap to navigate to each team's section and read their sticky notes directly. If a team is skipping the Learning Science Justification section, type a prompt sticky note in yellow and place it directly inside the Justification box: "Required before gallery walk." They will see it appear and respond without audio interruption.

**FigJam tip:** If a team is working well and you do not need to intervene, use **Cursor Chat** to send a board-wide time update at the 10-minute and 5-minute marks: "10 minutes remaining — start the Learning Science Justification section" and "5 minutes — wrap up." Do not interrupt teams with audio for routine time checks.

---

### Phase 6 Zone — Cross-Team Critique (Gallery Walk)

**Contents:**

1. **Gallery display area:** Link to each team's Phase 5 section using a connector arrow and a text label, or duplicate the completed Redesign Maps into this zone. If duplicating, label each copy clearly with the team name.

2. **Feedback columns:** Adjacent to each team's map, three labelled columns:
   - Green column: "Strength — What aligns with learning science? Name the commitment."
   - Yellow column: "Tension — Where might the design impair learning? Name the commitment."
   - Blue column: "Clarification question — What needs more explanation?"

   Pre-place empty sticky notes in each column in the correct colour.

3. **Optional: Stamp reaction layer:** FigJam's built-in stamps (the stamp tool in the toolbar) can be used as a rapid reaction layer before written feedback. Ask participants to add a checkmark stamp to one strength and a question mark stamp to one tension before writing their sticky note. This forces them to read all maps before committing to written feedback.

**FigJam tip:** Use **Spotlight** to open the gallery walk. Navigate to the first team's map, enter Spotlight, and briefly orient participants: "You have 15 minutes. Review at least two maps. Use the coloured sticky notes in each column. Name the commitment your feedback connects to." Then exit Spotlight and allow free navigation.

**FigJam tip:** If feedback is vague ("this is good" / "this seems incomplete"), use Cursor Chat to send a prompt: "For each note you add — which learning science commitment does it connect to?" Send this once, three to four minutes in, as a board-wide message.

**Optional voting:** FigJam does not have a built-in dot voting feature equivalent to Miro. Use one of these alternatives:
- **Stamp voting:** Ask participants to add a thumbs-up stamp to the tension they think is most critical. Count stamps manually and read out the top-voted tensions in Phase 7.
- **React emoji:** Use FigJam's emoji reactions (E on keyboard) to mark priority tensions with a 🔴 or ⚠️.
- **Manual tally:** Ask each participant to type their top-voted tension in a shared text box at the bottom of the gallery zone. You read results aloud.

---

### Phase 7 Zone — Collaboration Charter

**Contents:**

1. **Individual commitments area:** Four prompt lines, each with a sticky note cluster in the participant's role colour:
   - One decision I will no longer make alone
   - One role I need earlier in the design process
   - One learning science principle I will use in future discussions
   - One process change we will implement in the next design cycle

2. **30-day follow-up card:** A static text card with the three share-out prompts for the follow-up session:
   - One decision you made differently since the workshop
   - One place where collaboration improved
   - One remaining misalignment that needs addressing

   Below: a line for participants to note the follow-up date. Include the calendar invite link as a hyperlink in the card text.

3. **Closing retrieval task area:** Section background set to dark (`#1A1A1A`). Large white text: "No notes. Write three things."
   - How you now define learning
   - One way your role mediates cognitive change
   - One collaboration commitment you are taking forward

   A sticky note cluster below for participant responses.

**FigJam tip:** Use Spotlight to enter this zone for the closing retrieval task. Do not exit Spotlight until you have finished reading the three prompts aloud. Then exit Spotlight and remain silent for 60 seconds. The silence is part of the task. Participants write faster when they are not waiting for permission.

## FigJam feature reference

---

### Sections

Sections (press S) are the primary structural element on a FigJam board. They define zones, group content and allow you to navigate the board by section name. Click a section header to select it; double-click to rename.

Sections can be nested inside other sections in recent FigJam versions. Use this in Phase 4 and Phase 5 to create per-team sub-sections within the larger phase section.

Sections do not lock content inside them. Participants can drag items out of a section. Keep sticky note areas visually bounded with shapes or text rules to reduce accidental displacement.

### Sticky notes

Press S then N, or select the sticky note tool from the toolbar. Set the colour before placing. In FigJam, sticky note colours are: yellow, green, blue, orange, pink, purple, grey, and white.

Map the workshop role colours to FigJam's available palette:
- Curriculum Design → Yellow
- Learning / Experience Design → Blue
- Multimedia Design → Green
- Learning Technology → Orange

One idea per note. If a participant writes a long paragraph on a sticky note, prompt them to split it into two or three notes: "One constraint per note. What are the two things you are actually saying?"

### Timer

Insert a timer via the toolbar (the clock icon, or press T). The timer is visible to all participants simultaneously — it appears on the board as a widget, not in a separate panel. This is one of FigJam's strongest facilitation features: it externalises the time constraint without audio interruption.

Pre-set the timer for each activity zone before the session begins. Start it at the moment you give the instruction. Set the duration exactly as specified in the run of show. Do not round up — a 2-minute recall task must stay at 2 minutes.

### Spotlight

Spotlight (the megaphone icon in the toolbar, or press L) pulls all participant views to your current location on the board. When you enter Spotlight, every participant's screen locks to your position and zoom level. When you exit, participants regain free navigation.

Use Spotlight for every whole-group moment: reveals, transitions, worked examples and the closing retrieval task. Exit Spotlight immediately when participants need to work independently or in teams.

Spotlight does not restrict editing. Participants can still add sticky notes while in Spotlight. This is by design — you can spotlight the prompt while participants write their responses simultaneously.

### Cursor Chat

Press / on the keyboard (while on the board, not in a text element) to open Cursor Chat. Type a message and press Enter. The message appears above your cursor and is visible to all participants for a few seconds before fading.

Use Cursor Chat for:
- Time checks during independent and team work ("5 minutes remaining")
- Prompts to refocus ("Name the commitment — which one applies here?")
- Transitions ("When you finish, navigate to the Phase 4 section")

Do not use Cursor Chat for complex instructions. Keep messages under 10 words. For longer instructions, exit Spotlight and speak.

### Stamps and reactions

FigJam's stamp tool (toolbar > Stamp, or press E for reactions) provides a lightweight, non-verbal feedback layer. Use stamps during Phase 6 as an alternative to dot voting. Stamps are visible to all participants and can be added quickly without writing.

Reserve stamps for deliberate use. If participants use them freely throughout the session, they lose signal value for the gallery walk.

### Locking elements

Right-click any element > Lock to prevent participants from moving or editing it. Lock:
- All section headers and zone titles
- All prompt text elements
- The covering shapes over reveal content (you will unlock and delete these when revealing)
- The fallback sample artefact in Phase 4

To unlock when you are ready to reveal: right-click > Unlock, then delete the covering shape.

Do not lock sticky note clusters. Participants must be able to add, move and edit notes freely.

### Minimap

The minimap (bottom-right corner of the board) shows the full board at a reduced scale. Click anywhere on the minimap to jump to that location. Use this to navigate between team sections during Phase 4 and Phase 5 without losing your place.

During Phase 4, use the minimap to monitor which team areas have active editing (indicated by participant cursors). Navigate to quiet teams to check whether they need prompting.

### Sharing and links

Share the board via the Share button (top right). Set permissions to "Anyone with the link can edit." Copy the link and send it to participants at T minus 10 minutes.

If your Figma organisation restricts guest access, share with specific email addresses instead. This requires participants to have Figma accounts.

### Screen share fallback

If FigJam becomes inaccessible mid-session, switch to the slides deck (workshop-slides.pdf or .pptx) and share your screen. The slides carry all activity prompts. Instruct participants to use a shared document for collaborative writing until FigJam is restored. Do not end the session for a FigJam outage.

## After the session

### Saving the board

The FigJam board is the persistent record of the session. After the workshop:

1. Export each team's Redesign Map as a PNG or PDF. In FigJam, select the section containing the map, right-click > Copy as PNG (or use File > Export). Share with participants by email within 24 hours.
2. Take a full board export (File > Export frames to PDF or PNG) for your facilitator records.
3. Change board permissions to view-only after exporting. Go to Share > set to "Anyone with the link can view." This prevents post-session editing while keeping the board accessible for reference.

### Sharing for the 30-day follow-up

Include the FigJam board link in the post-session summary email with a note that it is now view-only. Ask participants to locate their Phase 7 commitment sticky note before the 30-day follow-up session.

In the 30-day follow-up, re-open the board (set back to edit access if the session is interactive) and navigate to each team's Phase 4 and Phase 5 sections. Use the completed sticky notes as reference points when participants share what has changed since the workshop.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Participant cannot access the board | Check permissions (edit vs view); confirm they are logged in to a Figma account or using the correct guest link; resend the link; try a different browser |
| Guest link not allowing editing | Your org Figma settings may restrict guest editing; invite participants by email instead, or request a guest editing exemption from your Figma admin |
| Participant accidentally deletes a zone element | Press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z to undo immediately; if too late, use Edit > Version history to restore a previous state |
| Two participants editing the same sticky note | FigJam handles concurrent edits on the same note poorly; ask one participant to create a new note rather than sharing one |
| Board is slow or lagging | Ask participants to close other Figma or browser tabs; zoom out to reduce rendered elements; very large boards with many images can lag on older hardware |
| FigJam is inaccessible | Switch to screen-shared slides; use a shared document for participant writing; do not end the session |
| Participant is on mobile | FigJam mobile access is limited and editing is unreliable; ask participants to use a laptop or desktop; if unavailable, pair them with a co-facilitator or nearby participant to enter their contributions |
| Team has no artefact to diagnose | Navigate to the fallback artefact in Phase 4 and share it with the team via Cursor Chat: "Use the sample artefact at the bottom of Phase 4 — it has the same structure as a real module." |
| Spotlight disconnects a participant | Some participants may experience Spotlight as disorienting if their connection is slow; tell them they can navigate back to you by pressing Ctrl+Shift+H (Cmd+Shift+H) to fit the board to their screen |

---

## Design decisions and rationale

### Why FigJam is referenced in the workshop outline

The original workshop outline specifies FigJam as the platform for the Redesign Map template. This reflects two practical realities: FigJam is designed for collaborative whiteboarding within teams already on Figma, and it has a purpose-built template system that makes it straightforward to duplicate structured artefacts per team.

If your organisation does not use Figma, the Miro playbook covers identical content on an equivalent platform.

### Why left-to-right board layout

The left-to-right sequence mirrors the cognitive progression of the workshop: from individual to collective, from diagnosis to redesign, from divergence to commitment. Participants who zoom out mid-session see the full arc of the work. This reinforces the sense that the session is going somewhere, not cycling.

### Why Spotlight replaces Miro Presentation mode

FigJam's Spotlight is the closest functional equivalent to Miro Presentation mode. The key difference: Spotlight does not lock participant editing, whereas Miro Presentation mode is more restrictive. In practice this is an advantage — you can spotlight a prompt while participants simultaneously write their responses. Use this in Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 7 where you want participant attention on a specific area but their responses happening in real time.

### Why Cursor Chat replaces verbal time checks

Verbal time checks interrupt the cognitive flow of an activity. Cursor Chat delivers the same information as a visible, non-audio message on the board. Participants glance at the message and return to their work. Use it for routine operational updates (time remaining, transitions) and reserve your voice for facilitation moves that require a human response.

### Why colour-coded roles

Colour-coded sticky notes make role distribution visible at a glance during collaborative activities. When a team's Phase 4 sticky notes are all one colour, it is immediately clear that one role is dominating the diagnosis. The facilitator can intervene without asking who contributed what.

### Why covering shapes for reveals

Progressive reveal prevents participants from reading ahead and forming premature conclusions. The covering shape technique requires no special FigJam features: lock the shape, delete it when you are ready to reveal. This works regardless of participant access level and does not depend on any FigJam-specific functionality.
