## Minute-by-Minute Run of Show

---

### Pre-Session (T minus 30 to 0 min)

| Clock | Action |
|-------|--------|
| T minus 30 | Arrive. Arrange tables. Distribute materials. |
| T minus 20 | Open FigJam board or configure digital space. Test screenshare and audio. |
| T minus 10 | Post team assignments for Phases 4 and 5 (visible but not yet announced verbally). |
| T minus 5 | Participants begin arriving. Direct them to their Phase 1 seats (pre-mixed or open seating for Phases 1 to 3). |
| T minus 2 | Brief check: confirm pre-work completion with a show of hands or quick verbal check. Adjust Phase 2 approach if needed (see Facilitator Guide). |
| T 0 | Begin without preamble. |

---

### Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object (0–15 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 0:00 | 0 min | Begin immediately with writing prompt. No introduction. | Say: "Before we do anything else, write two things." |
| 0:00 | 1.5 min | Individual writing: define learning in one sentence; how do you know learning happened? | Silence is correct here. Do not fill it. |
| 1:30 | 2 min | Two or three volunteers share their definitions aloud. Facilitator writes 1 to 2 key words per definition on the whiteboard. No evaluation. | Listen for "activity" and "engagement" framing — these are the foils for the operational definition. |
| 3:30 | 2 min | Introduce the operational definition. Participants underline key words. | Read the definition aloud. Pause after "durable." |
| 5:30 | 3 min | Individual writing: what must learners do 6 to 12 months later, and what cognitive change is required? | Circulate briefly to confirm participants are applying the definition, not rephrasing their original answer. |
| 8:30 | 2 min | Take two or three responses from different roles. No deep debrief. | Redirect to the capability and cognitive change angle if responses stay at activity level. |
| 10:30 | 2 min | State the diagnostic norm. | Say it clearly and slowly. Pause afterward. |
| 12:30 | 2.5 min | Buffer and transition to Phase 2. | |
| 15:00 | — | Phase 1 ends. |

**Phase 1 checkpoint:** Participants can articulate why "completing a module" does not equal learning.

---

### Phase 2 — Learning Science Core (15–30 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 15:00 | 0 min | Transition: "We established what learning is. Now: what does the science tell us about how it works?" | No slides needed here. |
| 15:00 | 2 min | Part A: Recall task. Participants write three commitments from memory, no notes. | Call out clearly: "Close your notes. No looking." |
| 17:00 | 1 min | Reveal three commitments on whiteboard or screen. Show of hands: all three / two / one or fewer. | If more than half got fewer than two, add a brief 3-minute direct instruction pass before Part B. |
| 18:00 | 1 min | Brief framing of why recall difficulty is itself a learning science demonstration. | Keep this very brief. One sentence maximum. |
| 19:00 | 0 min | Transition to Part B. Direct participants to form role-based micro-groups. | In physical room: regroup by role. In digital: move to breakout rooms. |
| 19:00 | 10 min | Part B: Role-based application discussions. Three prompts per role. | Circulate across groups. Target groups that drift abstract. |
| 29:00 | 0 min | Reconvene. No full share-out. Transition directly to Part C. | |
| 29:00 | 5 min | Part C: Worked example. Present the misalignment case. Take two responses, then state the diagnosis. | Write the diagnosis on the whiteboard in three words: outcome, assessment, gap. |
| 34:00 | — | Phase 2 ends. Allow 4 minutes of buffer absorbed across the phase if needed. |

**Note on timing:** The outline places Phase 2 from 15 to 30 minutes. Part C runs to approximately 34 minutes in practice. Phase 3 can absorb this without consequence.

**Phase 2 checkpoint:** Participants can identify a misalignment between an outcome, an activity and an assessment using the three-commitment lens.

---

### Phase 3 — Role Mapping (30–50 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 30:00 | 0 min | Transition: redirect participants to role-based groups. | Physical: regroup. Digital: breakout by role. |
| 30:00 | 15 min | Part A: Role clarification. Each role group works through its three prompts. | Circulate. Redirect groups defending current practice toward specific artefacts. |
| 45:00 | 0 min | Reconvene. Do not debrief Part A at length. | Transition directly to Part B. |
| 45:00 | 5 min | Part B: Cross-role perspective taking. Pair with someone from a different role. 2 minutes per person. | In digital delivery: use random pairings in main room. Give a 30-second warning at the 4-minute mark. |
| 50:00 | 2 min | Bridge statement before Phase 4. Reveal mixed-role team assignments. | Read team assignments aloud and confirm seating or breakout room assignments. |
| 52:00 | — | Phase 3 ends. |

**Phase 3 checkpoint:** Each role can name a specific design decision it makes and connect it to at least one learning science commitment.

---

### Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis (50–75 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 52:00 | 1 min | Restate diagnostic norm. Teams settle into mixed-role groups with their artefact. | If any team has no artefact, provide the sample fallback now. |
| 53:00 | 5 min | Stage 1: Identify. Four questions. Teams point to specific elements in the artefact. | Circulate. Push for specific references to the artefact, not general observations. |
| 58:00 | 20 min | Stage 2: Diagnose misalignment. Two further questions. Teams identify contradictions and their severity. | Intervene if teams stay surface-level. Push for structural cause, not symptoms. |
| 78:00 | — | Phase 4 ends. |

**Note on timing:** Phase 4 runs 8 minutes over the outline's 50–75 min window due to Phase 3 spillover. The 5-minute break that follows compensates for this. Do not cut Stage 2 — it is the pivot point of the workshop.

**Phase 4 checkpoint:** Each team has a specific, named misalignment and a consensus view on which misalignment most impairs learning.

---

### Break (75–85 min, in practice approximately 78–88 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 78:00 | 10 min | Break. | Use this time to review Phase 4 observations and prepare two or three patterns to name after the break. |
| 88:00 | 2 min | Reconvene. Bridge statement: "Identify the one misalignment most blocking learning. That's your redesign focus." | Deliver this clearly before distributing materials. |
| 90:00 | — | Break ends. Transition to Phase 5. |

---

### Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign (85–110 min, in practice 90–115 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 90:00 | 2 min | Distribute or open redesign map templates. Brief walk-through of seven sections. | Do not explain every field. Say: "Your redesign needs to be coherent, not complete." |
| 92:00 | 23 min | Teams redesign using the template. | Circulate continuously. See the Facilitator Guide for common redesign errors and interventions. |
| 115:00 | 2 min | Two-minute warning. Ask teams to complete the Learning Science Justification section if not already done. | This section is a test of alignment. Do not let teams skip it. |
| 117:00 | — | Phase 5 ends. Teams prepare to post or display their redesign map. |

**Phase 5 checkpoint:** Every team has a completed redesign map with a specific capability object, named retrieval points and a completed Learning Science Justification section.

---

### Phase 6 — Cross-Team Critique (110–125 min, in practice 117–132 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 117:00 | 1 min | Direct teams to post maps on the wall or in digital space. Distribute sticky notes or direct reviewers to FigJam. | Give clear protocol: three sticky notes per redesign reviewed (green, yellow, blue). |
| 118:00 | 12 min | Gallery walk. Teams review at least two other redesigns. | Circulate. Ensure sticky notes name a learning science commitment, not just preference. |
| 130:00 | 3 min | Each team reads feedback on their own map silently. No cross-team discussion yet. | This is reading time, not debrief time. Keep it quiet. |
| 133:00 | — | Phase 6 ends. |

**Phase 6 checkpoint:** Every redesign map has received at least two sets of structured feedback (one strength, one tension, one question).

---

### Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter and Closing (125–135 min, in practice 133–143 min)

| Clock | Duration | Action | Facilitator note |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 133:00 | 3 min | Part A: Individual commitment writing. Four prompts. | Participants write first. No share-out until all four are written. |
| 136:00 | 2 min | Brief share-out: one response per prompt from different roles. | Keep this brisk. The purpose is social affirmation, not debate. |
| 138:00 | 3 min | Part B: 30-day follow-up plan. State the protocol, confirm the date, send or confirm calendar invitations. | Do not let this be aspirational. Confirm the date and send the invitation before people leave. |
| 141:00 | 5 min | Part C: Closing retrieval task. No notes. Three things. | Deliver the instruction clearly, then go silent. Do not fill the silence. |
| 146:00 | 1 min | Closing statement. | Do not give a long summary. One sentence and done. |
| 147:00 | — | Workshop ends. |

**Note on timing:** The workshop runs approximately 10 to 12 minutes over the 135-minute outline in normal conditions. If you need to hold the 135-minute mark, apply the contingency cuts listed in the Facilitator Guide before Phase 6.

**Phase 7 checkpoint:** Every participant has a completed commitment card and a calendar invitation for the 30-day follow-up.
