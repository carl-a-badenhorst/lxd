# Visual Design Specifications
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

This document describes every diagram, infographic and flow visual for the workshop. One specification per visual. Each specification covers: visual type and purpose, structural description, content inventory, interdependencies and production notes for Miro, FigJam or a design tool.

Visuals are ordered to match the session sequence. Produce them in this order so each builds logically on the last.

---

## How to use these specifications

Each specification is a brief for a designer, a prompt for an AI diagram generator or an instruction set for a Miro/FigJam builder. The specification describes intent and content. It does not prescribe typefaces, exact pixel sizes or colour palettes unless the workshop colour system is directly relevant.

**Workshop colour system (apply throughout):**
- Curriculum Design: yellow
- Learning or Experience Design: blue
- Multimedia Design: green
- Learning Technology: orange
- Neutral surface/background: light grey (#F5F5F5) for working phases, dark (#111111) for retrieval/recall tasks

## 0. Workshop Arc — Session Overview Flow

**Visual type:** Horizontal linear flow diagram with six labelled stage nodes and a subtitle track below each node.

**Purpose:** Orient participants to the full cognitive journey before it begins. Show that the session moves in one direction — from individual to collective, from divergence to commitment — and that each phase builds on the one before it. Display this on the landing zone or opening slide.

**Structure:**

Six nodes arranged left to right, connected by forward-pointing arrows. Each node is a circle or rounded rectangle. Below each node, a two-line subtitle: first line gives the phase name; second line gives the cognitive or social mode active in that phase.

| Node | Stage label | Subtitle line 1 | Subtitle line 2 |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Clarify | Framing the shared object | Individual → shared definition |
| 2 | Establish | Learning science core | Retrieval → shared commitments |
| 3 | Surface | Role mapping | Role lens → cross-role empathy |
| 4 | Diagnose | Cross-role diagnosis | Real artefacts → named misalignment |
| 5 | Redesign | Collaborative redesign | Diagnosis → coherent redesign |
| 6 | Commit | Collaboration charter | Insight → accountable commitment |

Between nodes 4 and 5, add a small horizontal break element labelled "Break — 10 min" below the arrow to mark the session mid-point.

Below the full row of nodes, add a single caption track spanning the full width:

> "Individual → Role groups → Mixed teams → Whole group"

This bottom track visualises the social formation shifts across the session.

**Colour:** Nodes 1–2 in neutral grey. Nodes 3–4 in warm amber. Node 5 in deep blue. Node 6 in dark charcoal. Arrows in mid-grey.

**Production notes:**
- Miro or FigJam: build as a row of six frames with arrow connectors. Lock the entire diagram after setup.
- Slides: place on the opening slide after the title, full-width.
- Print: A3 landscape works well as a participant reference card.

## 1. Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object

### 1A. Definition Spectrum

**Visual type:** Annotated horizontal spectrum with anchor labels at each end and a callout cluster at the right.

**Purpose:** Show that the operational definition of learning sits at one end of a spectrum, not in the middle. Most existing mental models describe "activity completion" (left end). The workshop moves participants toward "durable capability" (right end). Reveal this after the initial writing task, not before.

**Structure:**

A single horizontal line spanning the full width of the frame. At the left end: a label reading "Activity completion" with two supporting examples below in small text — "Watched the module" and "Passed the quiz." At the right end: a label reading "Durable capability" with one supporting example — "Applies the skill 6–12 months later in real conditions."

Below the right-end label, a bordered callout box containing the operational definition in larger type:

> "Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance."

Below the definition, three annotated terms arranged horizontally as short callout cards:

| Term | Short explanation |
|------|------------------|
| Durable | Retained over time, not just during the lesson |
| Knowledge structures | Organised schemas in long-term memory, not isolated facts |
| Enables future | The test is transfer, not completion |

A subtle upward arrow above the spectrum points from left to right, labelled "Direction of design."

**Content inventory:**
- Spectrum line with left/right labels
- Two activity-completion examples (left)
- One durable-capability example (right)
- Operational definition callout box
- Three term cards: Durable / Knowledge structures / Enables future

**Colour:** Left anchor in muted grey. Right anchor and definition box in deep blue. Term cards in white with dark text.

**Production notes:**
- Reveal by removing a covering rectangle from the definition callout (Miro/FigJam).
- In slides: animate left anchor first, then spectrum, then right anchor, then definition box, then three term cards sequentially.
- Do not show this visual until after participants have written their own definitions.

### 1B. Capability Object Logic Model

**Visual type:** Simple three-box input/output logic model with connecting arrows.

**Purpose:** Give participants a concrete structure for specifying their design object. Show that "cognitive change required" is the mechanism linking design decisions to learner capability. This is not abstract — it is the design question participants need to answer before Phase 4.

**Structure:**

Three boxes arranged vertically, connected by downward arrows.

**Box 1 (top):** "Design decisions" — label above the box, interior text: "What choices does each role make to cause the cognitive change?" Four small role-colour dots in the bottom-left corner of the box (yellow, blue, green, orange) to indicate that all four roles contribute here.

**Arrow 1:** Downward, labelled "cause"

**Box 2 (centre):** "Cognitive change required" — label above the box, interior text: "What must shift in the learner's knowledge structures for capability to develop?" This is the largest box, visually heavier than the others.

**Arrow 2:** Downward, labelled "produces"

**Box 3 (bottom):** "Learner capability 6–12 months later" — label above the box, interior text: "What must the learner do in real conditions, after the learning event?" This box has a dashed border to signal that it is the future state being designed toward.

**Content inventory:**
- Three labelled boxes (Design decisions / Cognitive change required / Learner capability)
- Two labelled directional arrows (cause / produces)
- Role-colour dot cluster in Box 1
- Dashed border on Box 3

**Colour:** Box 2 in dark charcoal (it is the pivot). Box 1 and Box 3 in neutral grey. Arrows in mid-grey.

**Production notes:**
- Place this alongside or below 1A as a paired visual.
- In Miro/FigJam, leave the interior text of Box 2 as a sticky note area so participants can add their specific cognitive change during the writing task.
- This diagram is also useful as a persistent reference card in the Phase 5 zone.

---

## 2. Phase 2 — Learning Science Core

### 2A. Three Commitments Reference Cards

**Visual type:** Three side-by-side vertical cards, each structured identically with a title, explanation and design implication.

**Purpose:** Make the three learning science commitments legible, memorable and actionable as design constraints. This is the reference structure participants will use in every subsequent phase. Reveal one card at a time during the facilitator debrief, not all three simultaneously.

**Structure:**

Three cards of equal size, arranged horizontally. Each card has three zones stacked vertically:

**Zone 1 (top, approximately 25% of card height):** Commitment title in large type. Background in dark charcoal.

**Zone 2 (middle, approximately 45% of card height):** One-sentence explanation of the commitment in plain language. Background in white or light grey.

**Zone 3 (bottom, approximately 30% of card height):** Design implication: a specific statement about what this commitment demands of design. Introduced by a right-pointing arrow icon or label "→ Design demands:". Background in a slightly tinted colour matched to the commitment.

Card content:

| Card | Title | Explanation | Design implication |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Memory precedes complex thinking | You cannot evaluate, apply or create without first having accessible knowledge structures in long-term memory. | Design must build foundational knowledge before asking learners to perform higher-order operations. |
| 2 | Retrieval strengthens memory | Actively recalling information from memory — not re-reading it — strengthens neural pathways and improves future retention. | Build retrieval events into the design: spacing, testing effects and recall prompts are not assessment tools, they are memory tools. |
| 3 | Cognitive load must be managed | Working memory has limited capacity. Extraneous load — effort not contributing to schema formation — crowds out germane learning. | Every design element must earn its place. Remove or simplify anything that does not contribute directly to the capability object. |

**Content inventory:**
- Three cards, each with title / explanation / design implication
- Arrow or label introducing the implication in each card

**Colour:** Card 1 tint: amber. Card 2 tint: teal. Card 3 tint: slate blue. Titles on dark background with white type.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, cover each card with a dark rectangle. Remove one rectangle at a time as you reveal.
- In slides, animate each card onto the screen individually: title first, then explanation, then design implication.
- These cards are the permanent reference for all diagnostic and redesign work. Keep them visible in the Phase 2 zone throughout the session.

---

### 2B. Misalignment Worked Example Diagram

**Visual type:** Vertical stacked comparison diagram with a gap indicator between expected and actual alignment.

**Purpose:** Give participants a concrete diagnostic schema they can apply in Phase 4. The diagram shows how a single misalignment propagates through a learning design: an outcome demands one cognitive operation; the assessment tests a different, lower-order one. Showing this visually makes the logical gap legible.

**Structure:**

Four stacked horizontal rows, connected by narrow downward arrows. A thick red horizontal line (labelled "Misalignment") sits between rows 2 and 3.

**Row 1 — Module outcome:** Label "Module outcome" on the left. Content: "Evaluate ethical frameworks." A small cognitive level tag on the right edge of the row: "Higher-order: schema application, judgment."

**Row 2 — Assessment used:** Label "Assessment" on the left. Content: "Multiple-choice quiz on definitions." A small cognitive level tag on the right: "Lower-order: recognition memory, label recall."

**Red gap line:** Between rows 2 and 3. Label on the right: "Misalignment: assessment does not test the cognitive operation named in the outcome."

**Row 3 — What the assessment actually tests:** Label "What is tested" on the left. Content: "Can the learner recognise the correct label for a concept they have seen before?" This row has a dashed border and muted colouring to indicate it is the actual (unintended) state.

**Row 4 — Commitment violated:** Label "Commitment violated" on the left. Content: "Memory precedes complex thinking — but designing for recognition does not build the schema needed for evaluation." Background tinted amber to link to Card 1 in Visual 2A.

**Content inventory:**
- Four labelled rows (outcome / assessment / what is tested / commitment violated)
- Red gap line with label
- Cognitive level tags on rows 1 and 2
- Amber tint on row 4 referencing commitment cards

**Colour:** Rows 1 and 4 in standard neutral. Row 2 in neutral. Gap line in red. Row 3 in dashed muted grey. Row 4 background in amber tint.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, cover rows 3 and 4 until the facilitator asks "What's the misalignment?" — reveal after taking two participant responses.
- In slides: reveal rows 1 and 2 first, pause for participant response, then reveal the gap line and rows 3 and 4.
- This diagram is the prototype for what participants will construct during Phase 4 with their own artefacts.

---

## 3. Phase 3 — Role Mapping

### 3A. Role Contribution Wheel

**Visual type:** Circular spoke diagram with a central object and four radiating role segments.

**Purpose:** Make visible that each role contributes a distinct but interdependent lens on the same shared object. The wheel resists hierarchy — no role sits above or outside the others. All four orient toward the centre.

**Structure:**

A central circle (approximately 20% of total diameter) labelled:

> "Durable Learner Capability
> (Object of Design)"

Four equal segments radiate outward from the central circle, each representing one role. Segments are separated by thin lines, not hard borders, to signal porosity rather than isolation.

**Segment content (each segment has a role label at the outer edge and three questions inside the segment body):**

| Segment | Role label | Three questions |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Top | Curriculum Design | How does this module align with programme capability? / Where is knowledge reinforced over time? / How is sequencing designed to support transfer? |
| Right | Learning or Experience Design | What cognitive operations must learners practice? / Where is retrieval embedded? / How is reasoning externalised? |
| Bottom | Multimedia Design | What cognitive function does each media element serve? / Where does media reduce or increase extraneous load? / How does representation support schema formation? |
| Left | Learning Technology | What affordances enable retrieval, feedback and collaboration? / Where does platform structure constrain pedagogy? / What analytics inform iteration? |

**Colour:** Each segment in its role colour (yellow / blue / green / orange) at reduced opacity so the questions remain legible. Central circle in dark charcoal with white type.

**Overlay element for Part B (cross-role perspective taking):** A pair of curved arrows overlaid on the wheel, curving from one segment to the non-adjacent segment (e.g. Curriculum Design to Multimedia Design), labelled "Cross-role pairing: name a design decision / identify the commitment it serves or violates." This overlay can be placed as a separate element that is shown only during Part B.

**Content inventory:**
- Central circle with object of design label
- Four role segments, each with role label and three diagnostic questions
- Role colours at reduced opacity
- Cross-role pairing overlay (Part B)

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, build the wheel as a locked background frame. Place empty sticky notes in the correct role colour inside each segment for participants to respond to the prompts.
- The cross-role pairing overlay is a separate locked element: show it when announcing Part B by toggling its visibility or removing a covering shape.
- This diagram also functions as a persistent reference during Phases 4 and 5 — participants can check which role owns which question when diagnosing misalignment.

---

## 4. Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis

### 4A. Two-Stage Diagnostic Funnel

**Visual type:** Vertical funnel diagram with two distinct stages and a single output node.

**Purpose:** Show that diagnosis is not a single step. Stage 1 is identification — making the current state of the artefact legible across four dimensions. Stage 2 is analysis — finding where those dimensions contradict each other and which contradiction most blocks learning. The funnel shape signals that divergent observation (Stage 1) narrows to a focused redesign target (output).

**Structure:**

**Stage 1 block (wide, top of funnel):** A horizontal band labelled "Stage 1 — Identify" at the top left. Inside the band, four equal-width columns, each representing a design dimension. Each column has a header and one question below it.

| Column | Dimension header | Question |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | Curriculum | What must learners remember? |
| 2 | Instruction | Where is retrieval structured? |
| 3 | Media | Where is thinking visible? |
| 4 | Platform | Where is cognitive load unnecessary? |

Each column header is tinted in the relevant role colour (yellow / blue / green / orange) to connect the diagnostic questions to the role responsible.

**Funnel sides:** Converging diagonal lines from the bottom edges of Stage 1 toward the Stage 2 block.

**Stage 2 block (narrower, middle of funnel):** A horizontal band labelled "Stage 2 — Diagnose misalignment" at the top left. Inside the band, two stacked question rows:

- Row 1: "Where do role decisions contradict each other?"
- Row 2: "Which contradiction most impairs learning?"

A right-pointing bracket on the right side of the Stage 2 block indicates these two questions work together as a paired analysis, not in sequence.

**Output node (bottom):** A bordered box at the bottom of the funnel, labelled "Redesign focus" with a prompt inside: "One specific misalignment — name it precisely." This box has a thick border and sits below a short downward arrow from Stage 2.

**Annotation track (optional, right side):** A narrow column to the right of the full funnel showing how each role's colour-coded sticky notes feed into the analysis. Four small role-colour squares stacked vertically beside Stage 1, with a converging arrow pointing into Stage 2. Label: "All four role perspectives on the same artefact."

**Content inventory:**
- Stage 1 band with four role-coloured dimension columns and one question each
- Funnel converging lines
- Stage 2 band with two diagnostic questions
- Output node (Redesign focus)
- Optional role-colour annotation track

**Colour:** Stage 1 column headers in role colours (reduced opacity). Stage 2 band in dark charcoal. Output node border in deep blue. Funnel body in light grey.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, build Stage 1 and Stage 2 as separate locked sections. Add sticky note areas below each question for participant responses.
- The output node is also a sticky note area — teams write their redesign focus here before the break.
- A callout box at the bottom of the Phase 4 zone reads: "This is your redesign focus for Phase 5." (From the Miro playbook.)

## 5. Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign

### 5A. Redesign Map Template Layout

**Visual type:** Structured single-page template diagram with seven labelled zones and a footer section.

**Purpose:** Provide a shared artefact structure that holds all seven redesign dimensions together in one view. The spatial arrangement of sections is not arbitrary — Capability Object sits at the top because it governs all other decisions. The Learning Science Justification footer is a test of coherence: if teams cannot complete it, the redesign is not grounded.

**Structure:**

The template is divided into three tiers and a footer.

**Tier 1 — Governing section (full width, top):**

One section spanning the full width of the template.

> **1. Capability Object**
> Prompt: "What must learners do 6–12 months later in real conditions? What cognitive change is required?"

Downward arrows from the bottom edge of this section pointing into Tier 2, labelled "governs all sections below."

**Tier 2 — Design decisions (five sections in two rows):**

Row A (three sections, equal width):

> **2. Retrieval Points** — "Where and when is knowledge retrieved after initial learning?"

> **3. Visible Reasoning** — "What prompts require learners to externalise their thinking?"

> **4. Load Reduction** — "What extraneous elements were removed or simplified?"

Row B (two sections, equal width):

> **5. Media Justification** — "What cognitive function does each medium serve?"

> **6. Platform Alignment** — "How does technology enable the design? What does the platform need to do that it currently cannot?"

Lateral arrows between sections in Tier 2 indicate interdependencies: a right-pointing arrow from section 2 to section 3 labelled "retrieval shapes reasoning prompts." An arrow from section 4 to section 5 labelled "load decisions inform media choice."

**Tier 3 — Programme connection (full width):**

One section spanning the full width.

> **7. Connection to Programme** — "How does this module contribute to programme-level capability?"

Upward arrows from Tier 2 into Tier 3 labelled "situate within the larger capability arc."

**Footer — Learning Science Justification (full width, bordered):**

A bordered box with a header "Learning Science Justification" and three prompt lines:

- Memory structures strengthened:
- Retrieval embedded at:
- Cognitive load decisions:

A label above the footer: "Complete this section before the gallery walk. If you cannot, the redesign is not yet grounded."

**Interdependency arrows summary:**
- Capability Object → all Tier 2 sections (governs)
- Retrieval Points → Visible Reasoning (retrieval shapes reasoning)
- Load Reduction → Media Justification (load decisions inform media)
- Tier 2 sections → Connection to Programme (situate within programme arc)
- All sections → Learning Science Justification (coherence test)

**Content inventory:**
- Seven labelled sections with prompt questions
- Three-tier spatial hierarchy
- Interdependency arrows with labels
- Learning Science Justification footer with three prompt lines
- Footer instruction label

**Colour:** Capability Object section header in deep blue (governing). Tier 2 section headers in mid-grey. Tier 3 section header in dark charcoal. Footer border in amber (draws attention as the coherence test).

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, build this as a locked template frame. Pre-place empty sticky note areas inside each section for participant responses. Duplicate once per team before the session.
- Section headers and prompt text are locked. Sticky note areas are not locked.
- The Learning Science Justification footer intentionally uses a different visual weight (amber border) so teams cannot visually ignore it.
- This template is also the artefact displayed in Phase 6.

---

## 6. Phase 6 — Cross-Team Critique

### 6A. Gallery Walk Feedback Protocol Diagram

**Visual type:** Three-column feedback grid with a review flow annotation above it.

**Purpose:** Make the structured feedback protocol legible before participants begin the gallery walk. The three-column structure prevents vague feedback by anchoring each note to a specific type: strength, tension or clarification. The review flow annotation shows the movement pattern: each reviewer visits at least two teams' maps.

**Structure:**

**Review flow annotation (above the grid):** A horizontal row of team map thumbnails (labelled "Team A," "Team B," "Team C," etc. — one per team). Below each thumbnail, a small sticky note icon. Between thumbnails, curved arrows indicating the review direction: "Each reviewer visits at least two maps. Leave three notes per map."

**Three-column feedback grid (main body):** Three equal-width columns with a header row and an open content area below.

| Column | Header | Header colour | Prompt | Prompt sub-note |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Strength | Green | "What aligns well with learning science?" | "Name the commitment." |
| 2 | Tension | Yellow | "Where might the design impair learning?" | "Name the commitment." |
| 3 | Clarification | Blue | "What needs more explanation?" | — |

Each column has an empty sticky note area below the header for participant notes. A small icon of a sticky note in the column colour sits inside the header.

**Anchor instruction below the grid:** A short text block in a bordered box:

> "Vague feedback is not useful. Every strength and tension must name the learning science commitment it connects to."

**Optional voting annotation (right side, marked as optional):** A small panel labelled "Optional: Prioritisation vote." Content: "After the gallery walk, each participant uses three dot votes to identify the one tension most critical across all redesign maps. Results surface system-level issues for Phase 7." This panel is visually separated from the main grid by a dashed border.

**Content inventory:**
- Team map thumbnail row with review flow arrows
- Three-column grid (Strength / Tension / Clarification) with colour-coded headers
- Prompt text and sub-note in each column
- Anchor instruction box
- Optional voting annotation (dashed border)

**Colour:** Column headers in green / yellow / blue. Anchor instruction box in dark charcoal with white type.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, pre-place sticky notes in the correct colour in each column beside every team's map.
- Show the review flow annotation during the facilitator briefing before movement begins, then keep it visible throughout Phase 6.
- If using Miro Voting, set up the voting session before Phase 6 and activate it after all feedback notes are placed.

---

## 7. Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter

### 7A. Individual Commitment Card

**Visual type:** Structured single-page card template with four labelled commitment lines and a role-colour border.

**Purpose:** Give each participant a personal artefact that captures their four commitments in a consistent, legible format. The card is small enough to be exported or photographed. The role-colour border makes contribution distribution visible when cards are placed side by side on the digital board.

**Structure:**

A portrait-orientation card divided into four equal horizontal bands, one per commitment prompt. Each band has a left-aligned label in bold and a blank line or sticky note area below it for participant writing.

| Band | Label | Prompt sub-text |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | "One decision I will no longer make alone" | (Which role needs to be involved?) |
| 2 | "One role I need earlier in the design process" | (At what stage?) |
| 3 | "One learning science principle I will use in future discussions" | (Which of the three commitments?) |
| 4 | "One process change we will implement in the next design cycle" | (Structural, not individual.) |

**Border:** A 4px border in the participant's role colour (yellow for Curriculum Design, blue for Learning/Experience Design, green for Multimedia Design, orange for Learning Technology). A small role label in the top-right corner of the card.

**Footer line:** A thin rule at the bottom with a single line: "Session date: _______ / 30-day follow-up: _______"

**Content inventory:**
- Four labelled commitment bands with prompt sub-text
- Role-colour border
- Role label in top-right corner
- Footer date line

**Colour:** Card background in white. Border and role label in role colour. Band labels in dark charcoal. Sub-text prompts in mid-grey.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, pre-place one card per participant in their role colour in the Phase 7 zone. Use a sticky note area inside each band for participant input.
- For printed delivery, produce a single A5 card template and print in the participant's role colour border before the session (or have them circle their role at the top).
- Export instructions after the session: participants screenshot or download their card and bring it to the 30-day follow-up.

---

### 7B. 30-Day Follow-Up Cycle Diagram

**Visual type:** Forward-arrow sequence diagram with three checkpoints and a closing reflection loop.

**Purpose:** Make the accountability structure of the 30-day follow-up concrete and visible. Participants need to see that the workshop does not end today — it moves into a scheduled accountability arc. The diagram also shows what the follow-up session will ask each role to report, so participants can begin tracking their practice immediately.

**Structure:**

A horizontal sequence of four nodes connected by right-pointing arrows, followed by a backward-curving arrow returning from the final node to a "next cycle" label.

**Node 1 — Workshop:** Labelled "Today." Subtitle: "Redesign map produced. Four commitments written. 30-day check-in scheduled."

**Arrow 1 → labelled "4 weeks"**

**Node 2 — 30-day check-in:** Labelled "30-day check-in — 30 minutes." Below the node, three share-out prompts in a small list:
1. One decision you made differently
2. One place where collaboration improved
3. One remaining misalignment

**Arrow 2 → labelled "group discussion"**

**Node 3 — System reflection:** Labelled "System-level reflection." Subtitle: "Which process changes have been implemented? What structural barriers remain? What additional support is needed?"

**Arrow 3 → labelled "if needed"**

**Node 4 — Next cycle:** Labelled "Next check-in or close." Subtitle: "Schedule a second check-in or confirm the changes are embedded."

**Return arrow:** A curved arrow from Node 4 looping back toward Node 1 (below the main sequence), labelled "Learning design as an ongoing, iterated practice — not a one-off event." This arrow reinforces the workshop's framing of design as a continuous, cross-role activity system.

**Content inventory:**
- Four sequence nodes (Workshop / 30-day check-in / System reflection / Next cycle)
- Three right-pointing arrows with time/mode labels
- Three share-out prompts beneath Node 2
- Return arrow with label

**Colour:** Node 1 in dark charcoal (grounding in today). Node 2 in deep blue (primary accountability checkpoint). Nodes 3 and 4 in mid-grey. Return arrow in muted teal.

**Production notes:**
- In Miro/FigJam, place this diagram in the Phase 7 zone as a static reference. It does not require participant input — it is a facilitator communication tool.
- In slides: use this as the final content slide before the closing retrieval task.
- The calendar invitation for the 30-day check-in should be sent before participants leave. Reference this diagram when announcing the follow-up.
