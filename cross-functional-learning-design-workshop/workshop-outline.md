# Workshop Outline (Revised)
## Designing Learning as a Cross-Functional Activity System

---

## 1. Description

This workshop brings together professionals in:
- Curriculum Design
- Learning or Learning Experience Design
- Multimedia Design
- Learning Technology

Participants collaborate to design learning experiences grounded in a shared understanding of what learning is.

Rather than treating design as a linear workflow, from curriculum to content to media to platform, the workshop reframes design as a coordinated activity system oriented toward durable learner capability.

**An activity system** is a social structure where multiple roles coordinate tools, rules, and artifacts toward a shared outcome—in this case, durable learner capability.

Participants will:
- Establish a shared operational definition of learning
- Understand key learning science principles that must shape design
- Clarify how each role mediates learning differently
- Diagnose misalignment across roles
- Redesign a learning experience collaboratively
- Establish collaboration norms for future work

The workshop is grounded in the Integrated Learning Design Framework, CHAT + LITE. This framework integrates:
- Learning as transformation of participation in meaningful activity systems (CHAT)
- Evidence-based instructional design across Learners, Instruction, Technologies and Environment (LITE)

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to:

1. Align all roles around a shared **object of design**, defined as durable capability rather than activity completion
2. Build a baseline understanding of core learning science principles
3. Clarify distinct yet interdependent role responsibilities
4. Improve cross-functional coherence in course, module and programme design
5. Establish shared design language and collaboration protocols

**Note:** Throughout this document, **object of design** refers to the shared goal all roles are working toward—not an artifact, but the cognitive change learners must achieve.

This is a design training session, not a conceptual seminar.

Participants will leave with:
- A redesigned learning experience artefact
- A shared operational definition of learning
- Practical learning science commitments
- A cross-role collaboration charter
- A 30-day follow-up plan

---

## 3. Workshop Objectives

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Define learning operationally as durable cognitive change that enables future participation
2. Explain three core learning science commitments:
   - Memory precedes complex thinking
   - Retrieval strengthens memory
   - Cognitive load must be managed
3. Articulate the distinct contribution of:
   - Curriculum Design
   - Learning or Experience Design
   - Multimedia Design
   - Learning Technology
4. Diagnose misalignment between:
   - Programme outcomes
   - Instructional design
   - Media use
   - Technology affordances
5. Collaboratively redesign a learning experience aligned to:
   - A clear capability object
   - Retrieval structures
   - Visible reasoning
   - Appropriate media mediation
   - Platform affordances
6. Establish cross-role collaboration commitments

---

## 4. The Learning Journey

The workshop follows a deliberate progression.

### Stage 1 — Clarify What Learning Is
Participants move from vague or activity-based definitions of learning to an operational definition rooted in durable cognitive change.

### Stage 2 — Establish Shared Commitments
Participants internalize three learning science constraints that shape design decisions.

### Stage 3 — Surface Role Differences
Each role articulates how it mediates learning within the broader system.

### Stage 4 — Diagnose Misalignment
Participants identify where learning breaks down across curriculum, instruction, media and technology.

### Stage 5 — Collaborative Redesign
Teams redesign a learning experience using shared principles and coordinated roles.

### Stage 6 — Commit to Improved Collaboration
Participants formalize structural improvements to collaboration.

Throughout, the workshop models:
- **Retrieval**, as participants recall commitments
- **Externalisation**, through design artefacts
- **Iteration**, through peer critique
- **Object orientation**, through a shared capability focus

---

## 5. Detailed Agenda (135 Minutes)

### Phase 1 — Framing the Shared Object (0–15 min)

#### Activity: Define Learning

Participants write:
- Define learning in one sentence
- How do you know when learning has happened?

The facilitator introduces the operational definition:

> **Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.**

Participants then identify:
- What capability must learners demonstrate 6 to 12 months later?
- What cognitive change must occur for that to be possible?

**Outcome:** The shared object of design is clarified.

**Diagnostic Norm:**
> "We're diagnosing the system, not individuals. Misalignment is structural, not personal. Our goal is coherence, not blame."

---

### Phase 2 — Learning Science Core (15–30 min)

Since participants completed pre-work introducing the three learning science commitments, this phase focuses on **application and retrieval practice**.

#### Part A: Recall (5 min)
Without notes, participants write the three commitments from memory:
1. Memory precedes complex thinking
2. Retrieval strengthens memory
3. Cognitive load must be managed

#### Part B: Role-Based Application (10 min)
Participants form role-based micro-groups and respond to:
- Where is retrieval structured in your typical work?
- Where might cognitive load be excessive?
- Where is thinking hidden?

#### Part C: Worked Example (5 min)
Facilitator demonstrates misalignment diagnosis:

> **Module outcome:** "Evaluate ethical frameworks"  
> **Assessment:** Multiple-choice quiz on definitions  
> **Misalignment:** Evaluation (higher-order thinking) requires schema application, but assessment only tests recognition memory.

**Outcome:** Participants have a schema for applying learning science principles to design decisions.

---

### Phase 3 — Role Mapping (30–50 min)

#### Part A: Role Clarification (15 min)

Participants group by role and respond to the following prompts.

**Curriculum Design**
- How does this module align with programme capability?
- Where is knowledge reinforced over time?
- How is sequencing designed to support transfer?

**Learning or Experience Design**
- What cognitive operations must learners practice?
- Where is retrieval embedded?
- How is reasoning externalized?

**Multimedia Design**
- What cognitive function does each media element serve?
- Where does media reduce or increase extraneous load?
- How does representation support schema formation?

**Learning Technology**
- What affordances enable retrieval, feedback and collaboration?
- Where does platform structure constrain pedagogy?
- What analytics inform iteration?

#### Part B: Cross-Role Perspective Taking (5 min)

Pair with someone from a different role. Explain one design decision you made recently. Your partner identifies which learning science commitment it serves (or violates).

**Outcome:** Role differences become concrete, and participants build empathy for other perspectives.

---

### Phase 4 — Cross-Role Diagnosis (50–75 min)

Mixed-role teams analyze a real module or assessment they brought to the workshop.

#### Stage 1 — Identify (5 min)
1. What must learners remember?
2. Where is retrieval structured?
3. Where is thinking visible?
4. Where is cognitive load unnecessary?

#### Stage 2 — Diagnose Misalignment (20 min)
5. Where do role decisions contradict each other?
6. Which contradictions most impair learning?

Teams identify contradictions and misalignments. These tensions become the basis for redesign.

**Outcome:** Teams have diagnosed specific, actionable misalignments to address in Phase 5.

---

### Break (75–85 min)

---

### Phase 5 — Collaborative Redesign (85–110 min)

Teams redesign one learning experience using the **Learning Experience Redesign Map** template (provided as FigJam board or printed handout).

The redesign must include:
- A clear capability object
- At least two retrieval points
- Visible reasoning prompts
- Reduced extraneous load
- Media justified by cognitive function
- Platform affordances serving pedagogy
- Connection to programme-level outcomes

Each redesign includes a required section:

**Learning Science Justification:**
- What memory structures are strengthened?
- Where is retrieval embedded?
- What cognitive load decisions were made?

**Deliverable:** A one-page redesign map (completed template).

#### Redesign Map Template Structure

```
1. CAPABILITY OBJECT
   - What must learners do 6–12 months later?
   - What cognitive change is required?

2. RETRIEVAL POINTS
   - Where/when is this knowledge retrieved?

3. VISIBLE REASONING
   - What prompts externalize thinking?

4. LOAD REDUCTION
   - What extraneous elements were removed?

5. MEDIA JUSTIFICATION
   - What cognitive function does each medium serve?

6. PLATFORM ALIGNMENT
   - How does technology enable the above?

7. CONNECTION TO PROGRAMME
   - How does this module contribute to program-wide capability?

LEARNING SCIENCE JUSTIFICATION:
   - Memory structures strengthened:
   - Retrieval embedded at:
   - Cognitive load decisions:
```

**Facilitator Note:** Provide this template as a FigJam board or printed handout. Teams add sticky notes or write directly on the template.

---

### Phase 6 — Cross-Team Critique (110–125 min)

#### Gallery Walk Protocol (15 min)

Teams post redesign maps on the wall or in a shared digital space.

Reviewers complete **structured feedback** using sticky notes:

**For each redesign you review:**
1. **One strength** — What aligns well with learning science? (Green sticky)
2. **One tension** — Where might design impair learning? (Yellow sticky)
3. **One clarification question** — What needs more explanation? (Blue sticky)

Each team reviews at least two other redesigns.

**Outcome:** Teams receive specific, constructive feedback grounded in learning science principles.

---

### Phase 7 — Collaboration Charter & Closing (125–135 min)

#### Part A: Individual Commitments (5 min)

Participants complete:
- One decision I will no longer make alone
- One role I need earlier in design
- One learning science principle I will use in future discussions
- One **process change** we will implement in the next design cycle

#### Part B: 30-Day Follow-Up Plan (3 min)

Facilitator announces:

> "In 4 weeks, we'll meet for 30 minutes. Each role will share:  
> 1. One decision you made differently  
> 2. One place where collaboration improved  
> 3. One remaining misalignment"

Participants receive calendar invitations before leaving.

#### Part C: Closing Retrieval Task (5 min)

Without notes, write:
1. How you now define learning
2. One way your role mediates cognitive change
3. One collaboration commitment you're taking forward

**Outcome:** Participants leave with concrete commitments and a scheduled accountability check-in.

## 6. Pre-Work Primer

**To be sent 5–7 days in advance.**

### Why This Workshop Matters

Educational activity does not automatically produce learning.

Learning is durable cognitive change that enables future capability. This workshop aligns cross-functional roles around designing for that change.

---

### What Learning Is

**Working definition:**

> Learning is durable change in knowledge structures that enables future participation and performance.

**Implications:**
- Performance during teaching does not necessarily indicate learning
- Retrieval strengthens retention
- Cognitive overload impairs schema formation

---

### Three Learning Science Commitments

**Please watch this 8-minute video and arrive prepared to explain in your own words:**

[Link to video: Introduction to Learning Science Commitments]

#### 1. Memory precedes complex thinking

You cannot think critically about what you don't remember. Higher-order cognitive operations require accessible knowledge structures in long-term memory.

#### 2. Retrieval strengthens memory

Actively recalling information from memory (not just re-reading it) strengthens neural pathways and makes future retrieval easier.

#### 3. Cognitive load must be managed

Working memory is limited. Extraneous cognitive load (effort not contributing to learning) reduces capacity for building understanding.

---

### Shared Glossary

To ensure we use consistent language during collaboration:

- **Schema:** Organized knowledge structures in long-term memory
- **Retrieval:** Actively recalling information from memory
- **Cognitive load:** Mental effort required during learning
- **Extraneous load:** Effort not contributing to schema formation
- **Germane load:** Effort that builds understanding
- **Object of design:** The shared cognitive outcome all roles are working toward

---

### Reflect on Your Role

Before attending, consider:
- What decisions does your role typically make?
- Where do those decisions affect cognition?
- Where have cross-role tensions emerged?
- Where might learning science help resolve those tensions?

---

### Bring to the Workshop

- **One module or assessment artefact** (printed or digital)
- **Programme-level outcomes** document
- A brief description of **one cross-role misalignment** you've experienced

---

### Design Logic

This workshop ensures participants:
- Understand learning operationally
- Experience retrieval
- Apply learning science within their role
- Use it to guide cross-role collaboration
- Produce a concrete redesign artefact
- Commit to improved collective practice

Learning science becomes the shared arbitration language across roles. It is not an add-on but the foundation for design decisions.

## 7. Facilitator Notes

### Key Timing Adjustments

The revised workshop is **135 minutes** (extended from 120 minutes) to allow:
- Adequate time for learning science application (Phase 2: 15 min)
- Two-stage diagnosis with clear cognitive separation (Phase 4: 25 min)
- Structured gallery walk critique (Phase 6: 15 min)
- Proper closing with retrieval task and follow-up planning (Phase 7: 10 min)

### Critical Transitions

**Before Phase 3 (2 min bridge):**
> "In your role group, identify one decision you made this month. How does it connect to the three commitments?"

**Before Phase 5 (2 min bridge):**
> "Based on your diagnosis, what is the **one misalignment** most blocking learning? That's your redesign focus."

### Materials Required

- FigJam board with Redesign Map template (or printed copies)
- Sticky notes (3 colors: green, yellow, blue)
- Whiteboard or digital collaboration space
- Pre-work video link
- Programme outcomes documents
- Sample modules/assessments for analysis
- Calendar invitations for 30-day follow-up

### Common Participant Questions

**Q: "Our platform doesn't allow for retrieval structures. What do we do?"**  
A: That's a perfect example of technology constraining pedagogy. In Phase 5, identify what workarounds or advocacy for platform changes might be needed.

**Q: "Our roles work in sequence, not parallel. How does this apply?"**  
A: Even in sequential workflows, earlier roles can design with later constraints in mind. The collaboration charter should specify what information each role needs from others.

**Q: "What if we disagree on what 'learning' means?"**  
A: Use the operational definition as the arbitration point. If performance 6–12 months later wouldn't demonstrate capability, it's not learning—it's activity completion.

## 8. 30-Day Follow-Up Session Agenda

**Duration:** 30 minutes

### Part A: Individual Share-Outs (20 min)

Each participant shares (5 min per role group):
1. One decision you made differently since the workshop
2. One place where collaboration improved
3. One remaining misalignment that needs addressing

### Part B: System-Level Reflection (10 min)

Group discussion:
- Which process changes have been implemented?
- What structural barriers remain?
- What additional support is needed?
- Schedule next check-in (if needed)

**Outcome:** Reinforcement of learning transfer and identification of systemic issues requiring leadership intervention.
