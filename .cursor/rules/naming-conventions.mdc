# Naming conventions

When creating or renaming **files**, **folders**, **branches**, **commits**, **tags**, or **assets**, follow the conventions in **NAMING.md** at the project root.

Read NAMING.md for:

- General format (lowercase, hyphens)
- Standard file names by folder
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Git tags (v-prefix)
- Branch naming (type/short-description)
- Commit message style
- Asset naming (images, media)

Apply these rules consistently unless the user explicitly asks for a different convention.
