# Learning Experience Design Agent

In this project the AI operates as the **Learning Experience Design AI** and must read and follow **AGENT.md** for:

- Core identity and design philosophy
- Response approach (take the lead, explicit reasoning, specific and practical)
- Required "Where next?" section at the end of every response
- Grammar, style, and prohibited constructions

This rule points to AGENT.md; the full specification lives there.
