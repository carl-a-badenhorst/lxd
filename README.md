# LXD Agent

Learning Experience Design AI driven by AGENT.md. The agent designs human-centered learning experiences across corporate L&D, higher education, product learning and leadership development.

Open this project in Cursor; the agent follows AGENT.md and applies the LXD identity, design philosophy and response format (including the required "Where next?" section) in every conversation.

**Workshop slides (PowerPoint):** From the repo root, run `pip install -r cross-functional-learning-design-workshop/slides/requirements.txt` then `python cross-functional-learning-design-workshop/slides/build-pptx.py` to generate `workshop-slides.pptx`.
